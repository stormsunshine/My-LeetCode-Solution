# 194. Transpose File
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a text file `file.txt`, transpose its content.

You may assume that each row has the same number of columns and each field is separated by the `' '` character.

**Example:**

If `file.txt` has the following content:
```
name age
alice 21
ryan 30
```
Output the following:
```
name alice ryan
age 21 30
```

## Solution
Use `awk`. First loop over each row in file `file.txt` and append each field to the corresponding array (determined by the column). Next output each column from the original file.
```
# Read from the file file.txt and print its transposed content to stdout.
awk '{
    for (i = 1; i <= NF; i++) {
        if (NR == 1) {
            res[i] = $i
        } else {
            res[i] = res[i] " " $i
        }
    }
} END {
    for (j = 1; j <= NF; j++) {
        print res[j]
    }
}' file.txt
```
