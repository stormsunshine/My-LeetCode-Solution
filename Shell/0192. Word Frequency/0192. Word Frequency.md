# 192. Word Frequency
## Level
Medium

## Description
Write a bash script to calculate the frequency of each word in a text file `words.txt`.

For simplicity sake, you may assume:

* `words.txt` contains only lowercase characters and space `' '` characters.
* Each word must consist of lowercase characters only.
* Words are separated by one or more whitespace characters.

**Example:**

Assume that `words.txt` has the following content:
```
the day is sunny the the
the sunny is is
```
Your script should output the following, sorted by descending frequency:
```
the 4
is 3
sunny 2
day 1
```
**Note:**

* Don't worry about handling ties, it is guaranteed that each word's frequency count is unique.
* Could you write it in one-line using [Unix pipes](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Bash-Prog-Intro-HOWTO-4.html)?

## Solution
Use `xargs` to split words, where `-n 1` means the output contains one word for each line.

Use `sort` to sort the words for calculating each word's frequency.

Use `uniq -c` to output each word's frequency.

Use `sort -nr` to sort the words according to their frequencies descending.

Print each word and its frequency, so use `awk '{print $2,$1}'`.
```
# Read from the file words.txt and output the word frequency list to stdout.
cat words.txt | xargs -n 1 | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | awk '{print $2,$1}'
```
