# 195. Tenth Line
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a text file `file.txt`, print just the 10th line of the file.

**Example:**

Assume that `file.txt` has the following content:
```
Line 1
Line 2
Line 3
Line 4
Line 5
Line 6
Line 7
Line 8
Line 9
Line 10
```
Your script should output the tenth line, which is:
```
Line 10
```
Note:
1. If the file contains less than 10 lines, what should you output?
2. There's at least three different solutions. Try to explore all possibilities.

## Solution
Three possible solutions are as follows.

1. Use `awk`. NR represents the line number in `awk` command.
2. Use `sed`. Use `-n` to cancel default output (only final result is in the output), and use `p` to represent print, where `10p` means printing line 10.
3. Use `head` and `tail`. Restrict the line number to be printed.
```
# Read from the file file.txt and output the tenth line to stdout.
# The three solutions are as follows. Any one among the following solutions can be executed.
awk 'NR == 10' file.txt
sed -n 10p file.txt
tail -n +10 file.txt | head -n 1
```
