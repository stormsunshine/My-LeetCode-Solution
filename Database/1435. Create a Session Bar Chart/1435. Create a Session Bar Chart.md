## Description
Table: `Sessions`
```
+---------------------+---------+
| Column Name         | Type    |
+---------------------+---------+
| session_id          | int     |
| duration            | int     |
+---------------------+---------+
session_id is the primary key for this table.
duration is the time in seconds that a user has visited the application.
```

You want to know how long a user visits your application. You decided to create bins of "[0-5>", "[5-10>", "[10-15>" and "15 minutes or more" and count the number of sessions on it.

Write an SQL query to report the (bin, total) in **any** order.

The query result format is in the following example.
```
Sessions table:
+-------------+---------------+
| session_id  | duration      |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | 30            |
| 2           | 199           |
| 3           | 299           |
| 4           | 580           |
| 5           | 1000          |
+-------------+---------------+

Result table:
+--------------+--------------+
| bin          | total        |
+--------------+--------------+
| [0-5>        | 3            |
| [5-10>       | 1            |
| [10-15>      | 0            |
| 15 or more   | 1            |
+--------------+--------------+

For session_id 1, 2 and 3 have a duration greater or equal than 0 minutes and less than 5 minutes.
For session_id 4 has a duration greater or equal than 5 minutes and less than 10 minutes.
There are no session with a duration greater or equial than 10 minutes and less than 15 minutes.
For session_id 5 has a duration greater or equal than 15 minutes.
```

## Solution
For each bin, select the number of sessions that have duration in the bin. Use `union` to union the results.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select '[0-5>' as bin, count(session_id) as total from sessions where round(duration / 60, 2) >= 0 and round(duration / 60, 2) < 5
union
select '[5-10>' as bin, count(session_id) as total from sessions where round(duration / 60, 2) >= 5 and round(duration / 60, 2) < 10
union
select '[10-15>' as bin, count(session_id) as total from sessions where round(duration / 60, 2) >= 10 and round(duration / 60, 2) < 15
union
select '15 or more' as bin, count(session_id) as total from sessions where round(duration / 60, 2) >= 15;
```
