Table: `Product`
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key for this table.

```

Table: `Invoice`
```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |

| invoice_id  | int  |
| product_id  | int  |
| rest        | int  |
| paid        | int  |
| canceled    | int  |
| refunded    | int  |
+-------------+------+
invoice_id is the primary key for this table and the id of this invoice.
product_id is the id of the product for this invoice.
rest is the amount left to pay for this invoice.
paid is the amount paid for this invoice.
canceled is the amount canceled for this invoice.
refunded is the amount refunded for this invoice.
```

Write an SQL query that will, for all products, return each product name with total amount due, paid, canceled, and refunded across all invoices.

Return the result table ordered by `product_name`.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Product table:
+------------+-------+
| product_id | name  |
+------------+-------+
| 0          | ham   |
| 1          | bacon |
+------------+-------+
Invoice table:
+------------+------------+------+------+----------+----------+
| invoice_id | product_id | rest | paid | canceled | refunded |
+------------+------------+------+------+----------+----------+
| 23         | 0          | 2    | 0    | 5        | 0        |
| 12         | 0          | 0    | 4    | 0        | 3        |
| 1          | 1          | 1    | 1    | 0        | 1        |
| 2          | 1          | 1    | 0    | 1        | 1        |
| 3          | 1          | 0    | 1    | 1        | 1        |
| 4          | 1          | 1    | 1    | 1        | 0        |
+------------+------------+------+------+----------+----------+
Result table:
+-------+------+------+----------+----------+
| name  | rest | paid | canceled | refunded |
+-------+------+------+----------+----------+
| bacon | 3    | 3    | 3        | 3        |
| ham   | 2    | 4    | 5        | 3        |
+-------+------+------+----------+----------+
- The amount of money left to pay for bacon is 1 + 1 + 0 + 1 = 3
- The amount of money paid for bacon is 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 3
- The amount of money canceled for bacon is 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
- The amount of money refunded for bacon is 1 + 1 + 1 + 0 = 3
- The amount of money left to pay for ham is 2 + 0 = 2
- The amount of money paid for ham is 0 + 4 = 4
- The amount of money canceled for ham is 5 + 0 = 5
- The amount of money refunded for ham is 0 + 3 = 3
```

## Solution
Join table `Product` with table `Invoice` using `product_id`. Use `join` so that no `null` values will be introduced. For each column in `Invoice`, calculate the sum of the values group by `product_id`. Order the result by `name`.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select name, sum(rest) as rest, sum(paid) as paid, sum(canceled) as canceled, sum(refunded) as refunded
    from Product join Invoice
    on Product.product_id = Invoice.product_id
    group by Product.product_id
    order by name;
```
