# 615. Average Salary Departments VS Company
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given two tables as below, write a query to display the comparison result (higher/lower/same) of the average salary of employees in a department to the company's average salary.

Table: `salary`
```
| id | employee_id | amount | pay_date   |
|----|-------------|--------|------------|
| 1  | 1           | 9000   | 2017-03-31 |
| 2  | 2           | 6000   | 2017-03-31 |
| 3  | 3           | 10000  | 2017-03-31 |
| 4  | 1           | 7000   | 2017-02-28 |
| 5  | 2           | 6000   | 2017-02-28 |
| 6  | 3           | 8000   | 2017-02-28 |
```

The **employee_id** column refers to the **employee_id** in the following table `employee`.
```
| employee_id | department_id |
|-------------|---------------|
| 1           | 1             |
| 2           | 2             |
| 3           | 2             |
```

So for the sample data above, the result is:

```
| pay_month | department_id | comparison  |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|
| 2017-03   | 1             | higher      |
| 2017-03   | 2             | lower       |
| 2017-02   | 1             | same        |
| 2017-02   | 2             | same        |
```

**Explanation**

In March, the company's average salary is (9000+6000+10000)/3 = 8333.33...

The average salary for department '1' is 9000, which is the salary of **employee_id** '1' since there is only one employee in this department. So the comparison result is 'higher' since 9000 > 8333.33 obviously.

The average salary of department '2' is (6000 + 10000)/2 = 8000, which is the average of **employee_id** '2' and '3'. So the comparison result is 'lower' since 8000 < 8333.33.

With he same formula for the average salary comparison in February, the result is 'same' since both the department '1' and '2' have the same average salary with the company, which is 7000.

## Solution
First, calculate the average salary of the company in each month. Secondly, calculate the average salaries of the departments in each month. Thirdly, join the two query results using `pay_month`, and use `case-when` statement to determine the results.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select department_salary.pay_month, department_id,
    case
        when department_avg > company_avg then 'higher'
        when department_avg < company_avg then 'lower'
        else 'same'
    end as comparison
    from (
        select department_id, avg(amount) as department_avg, date_format(pay_date, '%Y-%m') as pay_month
            from salary join employee on salary.employee_id = employee.employee_id
            group by department_id, pay_month
    ) as department_salary
    join (
        select avg(amount) as company_avg, date_format(pay_date, '%Y-%m') as pay_month
            from salary group by date_format(pay_date, '%Y-%m')
    ) as company_salary
    on department_salary.pay_month = company_salary.pay_month;
```
