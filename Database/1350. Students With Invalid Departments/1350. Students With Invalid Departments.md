```

## Solution
For each entry in `Students` table, if `department_id` is not in `id` of `Departments` table, then the department with `department_id` no longer exists. Therefore, select the fields `id` and `name` from `Students`, and select the entries such that `department_id` are not in `id` field of `Departments` table.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select id, name from Students where department_id not in (select id from Departments);
```
