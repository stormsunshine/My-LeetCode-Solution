## Description
Table `Accounts`:
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| name          | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
the id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the account id and the user name of each account.
```

Table `Logins`:
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| login_date    | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may contain duplicates.
This table contains the account id of the user who logged in and the login date. A user may log in multiple times in the day.
```

Write an SQL query to find the id and the name of active users.

Active users are those who logged in to their accounts for 5 or more consecutive days.

Return the result table **ordered** by the id.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Accounts table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 1  | Winston  |
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+

Logins table:
+----+------------+
| id | login_date |
+----+------------+
| 7  | 2020-05-30 |
| 1  | 2020-05-30 |
| 7  | 2020-05-31 |
| 7  | 2020-06-01 |
| 7  | 2020-06-02 |
| 7  | 2020-06-02 |
| 7  | 2020-06-03 |
| 1  | 2020-06-07 |
| 7  | 2020-06-10 |
+----+------------+

Result table:
+----+----------+
| id | name     |
+----+----------+
| 7  | Jonathan |
+----+----------+
User Winston with id = 1 logged in 2 times only in 2 different days, so, Winston is not an active user.
User Jonathan with id = 7 logged in 7 times in 6 different days, five of them were consecutive days, so, Jonathan is an active user
```

**Follow up question:**

Can you write a general solution if the active users are those who logged in to their accounts for `n` or more consecutive days?

## Solution
For each `id`, if there are at least consecutive values of `login_date` in table `Logins`, then `id` should be selected. Select such values of `id` and the corresponding values of `name` from `Accounts` table.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select id, name from Accounts where id in (
    select l1.id from Logins l1, Logins l2, Logins l3, Logins l4, Logins l5
        where l1.id = l2.id and l2.id = l3.id and l3.id = l4.id and l4.id = l5.id
        and datediff(l2.login_date, l1.login_date) = 1
        and datediff(l3.login_date, l2.login_date) = 1
        and datediff(l4.login_date, l3.login_date) = 1
        and datediff(l5.login_date, l4.login_date) = 1
) order by id;
```
