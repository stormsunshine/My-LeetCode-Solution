Write an SQL query to report the number of grand slam tournaments won by each player. Do not include the players who did not win any tournament.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Players table:
+-----------+-------------+
| player_id | player_name |
+-----------+-------------+
| 1         | Nadal       |
| 2         | Federer     |
| 3         | Novak       |
+-----------+-------------+

Championships table:
+------+-----------+---------+---------+---------+
| year | Wimbledon | Fr_open | US_open | Au_open |
+------+-----------+---------+---------+---------+
| 2018 | 1         | 1       | 1       | 1       |
| 2019 | 1         | 1       | 2       | 2       |
| 2020 | 2         | 1       | 2       | 2       |
+------+-----------+---------+---------+---------+

Result table:
+-----------+-------------+-------------------+
| player_id | player_name | grand_slams_count |
+-----------+-------------+-------------------+
| 2         | Federer     | 5                 |
| 1         | Nadal       | 7                 |
+-----------+-------------+-------------------+

Player 1 (Nadal) won 7 titles: Wimbledon (2018, 2019), Fr_open (2018, 2019, 2020), US_open (2018), and Au_open (2018).
Player 2 (Federer) won 5 titles: Wimbledon (2020), US_open (2019, 2020), and Au_open (2019, 2020).
Player 3 (Novak) did not win anything, we did not include them in the result table.
```

## Solution
Use `union all` to join the four tournaments. Use `inner join` to join the entries. Finally, group the result by `player_id`.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select p.player_id, player_name, count(*) as grand_slams_count
    from Players p inner join (
        select Wimbledon as player_id from Championships union all
        select Fr_open from Championships union all
        select US_open from Championships union all
        select Au_open from Championships
    ) t
    on p.player_id = t.player_id
    group by p.player_id;
```
