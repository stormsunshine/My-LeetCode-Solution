```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+

The table logs the spendings history of users that make purchases from an online shopping website which has a desktop and a mobile application.
(user_id, spend_date, platform) is the primary key of this table.
The platform column is an ENUM type of ('desktop', 'mobile').
```
Write an SQL query to find the total number of users and the total amount spent using mobile **only**, desktop **only** and **both** mobile and desktop together for each date.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Spending table:
+---------+------------+----------+--------+
| user_id | spend_date | platform | amount |
+---------+------------+----------+--------+
| 1       | 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100    |
| 1       | 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100    |
| 2       | 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100    |
| 2       | 2019-07-02 | mobile   | 100    |
| 3       | 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100    |
| 3       | 2019-07-02 | desktop  | 100    |
+---------+------------+----------+--------+

Result table:
+------------+----------+--------------+-------------+
| spend_date | platform | total_amount | total_users |
+------------+----------+--------------+-------------+
| 2019-07-01 | desktop  | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-01 | mobile   | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-01 | both     | 200          | 1           |
| 2019-07-02 | desktop  | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-02 | mobile   | 100          | 1           |
| 2019-07-02 | both     | 0            | 0           |
+------------+----------+--------------+-------------+ 
On 2019-07-01, user 1 purchased using both desktop and mobile, user 2 purchased using mobile only and user 3 purchased using desktop only.
On 2019-07-02, user 2 purchased using mobile only, user 3 purchased using desktop only and no one purchased using both platforms.
```

## Solution
First, select the columns' values from table `Spending`, where the sum of amounts are calculated and `platform` has values `'desktop'`, `'mobile'` and `'both'`.

Next, obtain the four columns in the result table.

Finally, use `ifnull` to make the results of 0 appear in the result table.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select s1.spend_date, s1.platform, ifnull(s3.total_amount, 0) as total_amount, ifnull(s3.total_users, 0) as total_users
    from (
        select distinct spend_date, 'both' as platform from Spending union all
        select distinct spend_date, 'mobile' as platform from Spending union all
        select distinct spend_date, 'desktop' as platform from Spending
    ) s1 left join (
        select spend_date, platform, sum(amount) as total_amount, count(*) as total_users from (
            select spend_date, user_id, sum(amount) as amount,
                case when count(distinct platform) > 1 then 'both' else platform end as platform
                from Spending group by spend_date, user_id
        ) s2 group by spend_date, platform
    ) s3 on s1.spend_date = s3.spend_date and s1.platform = s3.platform;
```
