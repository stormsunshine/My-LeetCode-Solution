## Description
Table: `Followers`
```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| user_id     | int  |
| follower_id | int  |
+-------------+------+
(user_id, follower_id) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the IDs of a user and a follower in a following relationship where the follower follows the user.
```
Write an SQL query that will, for each user, return the number of followers.

Return the result table ordered by `user_id`.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Followers table:
+---------+-------------+
| user_id | follower_id |
+---------+-------------+
| 0       | 1           |
| 1       | 0           |
| 2       | 0           |
| 2       | 1           |
+---------+-------------+
Result table:
+---------+----------------+
| user_id | followers_count|
+---------+----------------+
| 0       | 1              |
| 1       | 1              |
| 2       | 2              |
+---------+----------------+
The followers of 0 are {1}
The followers of 1 are {0}
The followers of 2 are {0,1}
```

## Solution
For each `user_id`, count the number of entries in `Followers`. Group the result by `user_id` and order the result by `user_id`.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select user_id, count(*) as followers_count from Followers
    group by user_id
    order by user_id;
```
