## Description
Table: `Transactions`
```
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| id             | int     |
| country        | varchar |
| state          | enum    |
| amount         | int     |
| trans_date     | date    |
+----------------+---------+
id is the primary key of this table.
The table has information about incoming transactions.
The state column is an enum of type ["approved", "declined"].
```
Table: `Chargebacks`
```
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| trans_id       | int     |
| charge_date    | date    |
+----------------+---------+
Chargebacks contains basic information regarding incoming chargebacks from some transactions placed in Transactions table.
trans_id is a foreign key to the id column of Transactions table.
Each chargeback corresponds to a transaction made previously even if they were not approved.
```

Write an SQL query to find for each month and country, the number of approved transactions and their total amount, the number of chargebacks and their total amount.

**Note:** In your query, given the month and country, ignore rows with all zeros.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Transactions table:
+------+---------+----------+--------+------------+
| id   | country | state    | amount | trans_date |
+------+---------+----------+--------+------------+
| 101  | US      | approved | 1000   | 2019-05-18 |
| 102  | US      | declined | 2000   | 2019-05-19 |
| 103  | US      | approved | 3000   | 2019-06-10 |
| 104  | US      | approved | 4000   | 2019-06-13 |
| 105  | US      | approved | 5000   | 2019-06-15 |
+------+---------+----------+--------+------------+

Chargebacks table:
+------------+------------+
| trans_id   | trans_date |
+------------+------------+
| 102        | 2019-05-29 |
| 101        | 2019-06-30 |
| 105        | 2019-09-18 |
+------------+------------+

Result table:
+----------+---------+----------------+-----------------+-------------------+--------------------+
| month    | country | approved_count | approved_amount | chargeback_count  | chargeback_amount  |
+----------+---------+----------------+-----------------+-------------------+--------------------+
| 2019-05  | US      | 1              | 1000            | 1                 | 2000               |
| 2019-06  | US      | 3              | 12000           | 1                 | 1000               |
| 2019-09  | US      | 0              | 0               | 1                 | 5000               |
+----------+---------+----------------+-----------------+-------------------+--------------------+
```

## Solution
Use `date_format(trans_date, '%Y-%m')` to obtain the month of each transaction.

For approved transactions and chargeback transactions, select the entries respectively. As for chargeback transactions, do inner join on tables `Transactions` and `Chargebacks` using `id` in `Transactions` and `trans_id` in `Chargebacks`. Use `union all` to union the selected results. Obtain the values of the required fields as the final result.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select month, country, sum(if(state = 'approved', 1, 0)) as approved_count,
    sum(if(state = 'approved', amount, 0)) as approved_amount,
    sum(if(state = 'chargeback', 1, 0)) as chargeback_count,
    sum(if(state = 'chargeback', amount, 0)) as chargeback_amount
    from ((
        select date_format(trans_date, '%Y-%m') as month, country, amount, 'approved' as state
            from Transactions 
            where state = 'approved'
    ) union all (
        select date_format(Chargebacks.trans_date, '%Y-%m') as month, country, amount, 'chargeback' as state
            from Transactions inner join Chargebacks on Transactions.id = Chargebacks.trans_id
    )) temp
    group by temp.month, temp.country;
```
