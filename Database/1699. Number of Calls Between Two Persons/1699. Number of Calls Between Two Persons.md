## Description
Table: `Calls`
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| from_id     | int     |
| to_id       | int     |
| duration    | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table does not have a primary key, it may contain duplicates.
This table contains the duration of a phone call between from_id and to_id.
from_id != to_id
```

Write an SQL query to report the number of calls and the total call duration between each pair of distinct persons `(person1, person2)` where `person1 < person2`.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Calls table:
+---------+-------+----------+
| from_id | to_id | duration |
+---------+-------+----------+
| 1       | 2     | 59       |
| 2       | 1     | 11       |
| 1       | 3     | 20       |
| 3       | 4     | 100      |
| 3       | 4     | 200      |
| 3       | 4     | 200      |
| 4       | 3     | 499      |
+---------+-------+----------+

Result table:
+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
| person1 | person2 | call_count | total_duration |
+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
| 1       | 2       | 2          | 70             |
| 1       | 3       | 1          | 20             |
| 3       | 4       | 4          | 999            |
+---------+---------+------------+----------------+
Users 1 and 2 had 2 calls and the total duration is 70 (59 + 11).
Users 1 and 3 had 1 call and the total duration is 20.
Users 3 and 4 had 4 calls and the total duration is 999 (100 + 200 + 200 + 499).
```

## Solution
For each entry in table `Calls`, use the values of `from_id` and `to_id` as `person1` and `person2`, where the minimum is `person1` and the maximum is `person2`. Use `count(*)` as `call_count` and `sum(duration)` as `total_duration`. Finally, group the result by `person1, person2`.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select person1, person2, count(*) as call_count, sum(duration) as total_duration
    from (
        select
            if (from_id < to_id, from_id, to_id) as person1,
            if (from_id > to_id, from_id, to_id) as person2,
            duration
            from Calls
    ) temp
    group by person1, person2;
```
