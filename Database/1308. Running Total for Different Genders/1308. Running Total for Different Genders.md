```

## Solution
To obtain the total score, calculate the sum of `score_points` for all entries where `day` is less than or equal to the current `day`. Use `select sum(socre_points)` and use `gender` and `day` as filters to achieve this. Then select `gender`, `day` and the total score from table `Scores`, group the entries by `gender` and `day`, and order the entries by `gender` and `day`.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select s.gender, s.day, (select sum(score_points) from Scores where gender = s.gender and day <= s.day) as total
    from Scores s
    group by gender, day
    order by gender, day;
```
