## Level

## Description
Table: `Logs`
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| log_id        | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID in a log Table.
```

Since some IDs have been removed from `Logs`. Write an SQL query to find the start and end number of continuous ranges in table `Logs`.

Order the result table by `start_id`.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Logs table:
+------------+
| log_id     |
+------------+
| 1          |
| 2          |
| 3          |
| 7          |
| 8          |
| 10         |
+------------+

Result table:
+------------+--------------+
| start_id   | end_id       |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | 3            |
| 7          | 8            |
| 10         | 10           |
+------------+--------------+
The result table should contain all ranges in table Logs.
From 1 to 3 is contained in the table.
From 4 to 6 is missing in the table
From 7 to 8 is contained in the table.
Number 9 is missing in the table.
Number 10 is contained in the table.
```

## Solution
For each value `log` in table `Logs`, if `log - 1` does not exist in `Logs`, then `log` is the start id of an interval. If `log + 1` does not exist in `Logs`, then `log` is the end id of an interval. Join the start ids and the end ids to obtain the result.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select log_start.log_id as START_ID, min(log_end.log_id) as END_ID from 
    (select log_id from logs where log_id - 1 not in (select * from Logs)) log_start,
    (select log_id from logs where log_id + 1 not in (select * from Logs)) log_end
    where log_start.log_id <= log_end.log_id
    group by log_start.log_id;
```
