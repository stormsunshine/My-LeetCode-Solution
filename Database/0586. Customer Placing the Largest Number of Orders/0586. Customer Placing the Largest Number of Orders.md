| 4            | 3               | 2017-04-18 | 2017-04-28    | 2017-04-25   | Closed |         |
```
**Sample Output**
```
| customer_number |
|-----------------|
| 3               |
```
**Explanation**
```
The customer with number '3' has two orders, which is greater than either customer '1' or '2' because each of them  only has one order. 
So the result is customer_number '3'.
```
***Follow up:*** *What if more than one customer have the largest number of orders, can you find all the customer_number in this case?*

## Solution
In order to get the customer with the largest number of orders, the largest number of orders should be get first. Use `select count(order_number) from orders group by customer_number` to get each customer's number of orders. Use an inner `select` statement to get the largest number of orders. Then use an outer `select` statement to select the customer number with the largest number of orders.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select customer_number from orders
    group by customer_number
    having count(order_number) =
    (select count(order_number) from orders
        group by customer_number
        order by count(order_number) desc limit 1);
```
