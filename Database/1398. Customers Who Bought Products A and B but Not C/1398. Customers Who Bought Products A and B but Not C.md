## Description
Table: `Customers`
```
+---------------------+---------+
| Column Name         | Type    |
+---------------------+---------+
| customer_id         | int     |
| customer_name       | varchar |
+---------------------+---------+
customer_id is the primary key for this table.
customer_name is the name of the customer.
```

Table: `Orders`
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| order_id      | int     |
| customer_id   | int     |
| product_name  | varchar |
+---------------+---------+
order_id is the primary key for this table.
customer_id is the id of the customer who bought the product "product_name".
```

Write an SQL query to report the customer_id and customer_name of customers who bought products "A", "B" but did not buy the product "C" since we want to recommend them buy this product.

Return the result table **ordered** by customer_id.

The query result format is in the following example.
```
Customers table:
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 1           | Daniel        |
| 2           | Diana         |
| 3           | Elizabeth     |
| 4           | Jhon          |
+-------------+---------------+

Orders table:
+------------+--------------+---------------+
| order_id   | customer_id  | product_name  |
+------------+--------------+---------------+
| 10         |     1        |     A         |
| 20         |     1        |     B         |
| 30         |     1        |     D         |
| 40         |     1        |     C         |
| 50         |     2        |     A         |
| 60         |     3        |     A         |
| 70         |     3        |     B         |
| 80         |     3        |     D         |
| 90         |     4        |     C         |
+------------+--------------+---------------+

Result table:
+-------------+---------------+
| customer_id | customer_name |
+-------------+---------------+
| 3           | Elizabeth     |
+-------------+---------------+
Only the customer_id with id 3 bought the product A and B but not the product C.
```

## Solution
Join the tables `Customers` and `Orders` using `customer_id`. Use `having sum` to select the customers that bought products A and B but not C. The sums of A and B are both greater than 0 and the sum of C is 0.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select Customers.customer_id, customer_name
    from Customers left join Orders on Customers.customer_id = Orders.customer_id
    group by Customers.customer_id
    having sum(product_name = 'A') > 0 and sum(product_name = 'B') > 0 and sum(product_name = 'C') = 0
    order by Customers.customer_id;
```
