## Description
Table: `Activity`
```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| player_id    | int     |
| device_id    | int     |
| event_date   | date    |
| games_played | int     |
+--------------+---------+
(player_id, event_date) is the primary key of this table.
This table shows the activity of players of some game.
Each row is a record of a player who logged in and played a number of games (possibly 0) before logging out on some day using some device.
```

We define the *install date* of a player to be the first login day of that player.

We also define *day 1 retention* of some date `X` to be the number of players whose install date is `X` and they logged back in on the day right after `X`, divided by the number of players whose install date is `X`, **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

Write an SQL query that reports for each **install date**, the **number of players** that installed the game on that day and the **day 1 retention**.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Activity table:
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| player_id | device_id | event_date | games_played |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-01 | 5            |
| 1         | 2         | 2016-03-02 | 6            |
| 2         | 3         | 2017-06-25 | 1            |
| 3         | 1         | 2016-03-01 | 0            |
| 3         | 4         | 2016-07-03 | 5            |
+-----------+-----------+------------+--------------+

Result table:
+------------+----------+----------------+
| install_dt | installs | Day1_retention |
+------------+----------+----------------+
| 2016-03-01 | 2        | 0.50           |
| 2017-06-25 | 1        | 0.00           |
+------------+----------+----------------+
Player 1 and 3 installed the game on 2016-03-01 but only player 1 logged back in on 2016-03-02 so the day 1 retention of 2016-03-01 is 1 / 2 = 0.50
Player 2 installed the game on 2017-06-25 but didn't log back in on 2017-06-26 so the day 1 retention of 2017-06-25 is 0 / 1 = 0.00
```

## Solution
For `install_dt`, select the minimum date of each player. A minimum date of a player is a date such that no date is less than the player's date. For `installs`, count the number of players that logged in on the day. For `Day1_retention`, count the number of players that logged back in on the day right after the install date. Use `round` to round the results to 2 decimal places.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select a1.event_date as install_dt, count(a1.player_id) as installs, round(count(a3.player_id) / count(a1.player_id), 2) as Day1_retention
    from Activity a1 left join Activity a2
    on a1.player_id = a2.player_id and a1.event_date > a2.event_date
    left join Activity a3
    on a1.player_id = a3.player_id and datediff(a3.event_date, a1.event_date) = 1
    where a2.event_date is null
    group by a1.event_date;
```
