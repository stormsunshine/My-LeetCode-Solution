## Description
Table: `Teams`
```
+---------------+----------+
| Column Name   | Type     |
+---------------+----------+
| team_id       | int      |
| team_name     | varchar  |
+---------------+----------+
team_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table represents a single football team.
```
Table: `Matches`
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| match_id      | int     |
| host_team     | int     |
| guest_team    | int     | 
| host_goals    | int     |
| guest_goals   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
match_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row is a record of a finished match between two different teams. 
Teams host_team and guest_team are represented by their IDs in the teams table (team_id) and they scored host_goals and guest_goals goals respectively.
```

You would like to compute the scores of all teams after all matches. Points are awarded as follows:
* A team receives three points if they win a match (Score strictly more goals than the opponent team).
* A team receives one point if they draw a match (Same number of goals as the opponent team).
* A team receives no points if they lose a match (Score less goals than the opponent team).

Write an SQL query that selects the **team_id**, **team_name** and **num_points** of each team in the tournament after all described matches. Result table should be ordered by **num_points** (decreasing order). In case of a tie, order the records by **team_id** (increasing order).

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Teams table:
+-----------+--------------+
| team_id   | team_name    |
+-----------+--------------+
| 10        | Leetcode FC  |
| 20        | NewYork FC   |
| 30        | Atlanta FC   |
| 40        | Chicago FC   |
| 50        | Toronto FC   |
+-----------+--------------+

Matches table:
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
| match_id   | host_team    | guest_team    | host_goals  | guest_goals  |
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+
| 1          | 10           | 20            | 3           | 0            |
| 2          | 30           | 10            | 2           | 2            |
| 3          | 10           | 50            | 5           | 1            |
| 4          | 20           | 30            | 1           | 0            |
| 5          | 50           | 30            | 1           | 0            |
+------------+--------------+---------------+-------------+--------------+

Result table:
+------------+--------------+---------------+
| team_id    | team_name    | num_points    |
+------------+--------------+---------------+
| 10         | Leetcode FC  | 7             |
| 20         | NewYork FC   | 3             |
| 50         | Toronto FC   | 3             |
| 30         | Atlanta FC   | 1             |
| 40         | Chicago FC   | 0             |
+------------+--------------+---------------+
```

## Solution
For each team in table `Teams`, obtain the entries from table `Matches` and calculate the sum of scores accordingly. If an entry in table `Matches` have the current team as `host_team` or `guest_team`, then the current team may get three points, one point or no points. Otherwise, the team has ho points for the entry.

Finally, sort the results according to `num_points` in descending order and then according to `team_id` in ascending order.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select team_id, team_name, num_points from (
    select Teams.team_id, Teams.team_name, sum(
        case
            when Teams.team_id = Matches.host_team then
                case
                    when Matches.host_goals > Matches.guest_goals then 3
                    when Matches.host_goals = Matches.guest_goals then 1
                    else 0
                end
            when Teams.team_id = Matches.guest_team then
                case
                    when Matches.host_goals < Matches.guest_goals then 3
                    when Matches.host_goals = Matches.guest_goals then 1
                    else 0
                end
            else 0
        end
    ) as num_points
        from Teams left join Matches
        on Teams.team_id = Matches.host_team or Teams.team_id = Matches.guest_team
        group by Teams.team_id
) result
    order by result.num_points desc, result.team_id;
```
