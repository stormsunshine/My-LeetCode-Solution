Easy

## Description
Table: `Products`
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| product_id  | int     |
| low_fats    | enum    |
| recyclable  | enum    |
+-------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key for this table.
low_fats is an ENUM of type ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is low fat and 'N' means it is not.
recyclable is an ENUM of types ('Y', 'N') where 'Y' means this product is recyclable and 'N' means it is not.
```

Write an SQL query to find the ids of products that are both low fat and recyclable.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Products table:
+-------------+----------+------------+
| product_id  | low_fats | recyclable |
+-------------+----------+------------+
| 0           | Y        | N          |
| 1           | Y        | Y          |
| 2           | N        | Y          |
| 3           | Y        | Y          |
| 4           | N        | N          |
+-------------+----------+------------+
Result table:
+-------------+
| product_id  |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 3           |
+-------------+
Only products 1 and 3 are both low fat and recyclable.
```

## Solution
Simply select the entries in `Products` where both fields `low_fats` and `recyclable` have values `Y`. Select the values of `product_id` as the query result.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select product_id from Products where low_fats = 'Y' and recyclable = 'Y';
```
