Write an SQL query to find the number of times each student attended each exam.

Order the result table by `student_id` and `subject_name`.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Students table:
+------------+--------------+
| student_id | student_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 1          | Alice        |
| 2          | Bob          |
| 13         | John         |
| 6          | Alex         |
+------------+--------------+
Subjects table:
+--------------+
| subject_name |
+--------------+
| Math         |
| Physics      |

| 13         | John         | Programming  | 1              |
+------------+--------------+--------------+----------------+
The result table should contain all students and all subjects.
Alice attended Math exam 3 times, Physics exam 2 times and Programming exam 1 time.
Bob attended Math exam 1 time, Programming exam 1 time and didn't attend the Physics exam.
Alex didn't attend any exam.
John attended Math exam 1 time, Physics exam 1 time and Programming exam 1 time.
```

## Solution
If a student doesn't attend any exam of a subject, then the result table should have an entry of this student and this subject with 0 attended exams.

Join tables `Students` and `Subjects`, and then use the joined table to join table `Examinations` using fields `student_id` and `subject_name`. After the tables are joined, select `student_id`, `student_name`, `subject_id` and `count(Examinations.student_id) as attended_exams`. Use `group by` and `order by` accordingly.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select Students.student_id, student_name, Subjects.subject_name, count(Examinations.student_id) as attended_exams
    from (Students join Subjects on 1=1) left join Examinations
    on (Students.student_id, Subjects.subject_name) = (Examinations.student_id, Examinations.subject_name)
    group by Students.student_id, Students.student_name, Subjects.subject_name
    order by Students.student_id, Subjects.subject_name;
```
