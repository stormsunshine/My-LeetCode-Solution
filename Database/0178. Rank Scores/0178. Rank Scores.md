# 178. Rank Scores
## Level
Medium

## Description
Write a SQL query to rank scores. If there is a tie between two scores, both should have the same ranking. Note that after a tie, the next ranking number should be the next consecutive integer value. In other words, there should be no "holes" between ranks.
```
+----+-------+
| Id | Score |
+----+-------+
| 1  | 3.50  |
| 2  | 3.65  |
| 3  | 4.00  |
| 4  | 3.85  |
| 5  | 4.00  |
| 6  | 3.65  |
+----+-------+
```
For example, given the above `Scores` table, your query should generate the following report (order by highest score):
```
+-------+------+
| Score | Rank |
+-------+------+
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 4.00  | 1    |
| 3.85  | 2    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.65  | 3    |
| 3.50  | 4    |
+-------+------+
```

## Solution
Use `a` and `b` to represent selected scores and ranking respectively. Use `select count(distinct b.Score)` to make ranking consecutive.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select a.Score as Score,
(select count(distinct b.Score) from Scores b where b.Score >= a.Score) as Rank
from Scores a
order by a.Score desc;
```
