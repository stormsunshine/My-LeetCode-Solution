# 610. Triangle Judgement
## Level
Easy

## Description
A pupil Tim gets homework to identify whether three line segments could possibly form a triangle.

However, this assignment is very heavy because there are hundreds of records to calculate.

Could you help Tim by writing a query to judge whether these three sides can form a triangle, assuming table `triangle` holds the length of the three sides x, y and z.

```
| x  | y  | z  |
|----|----|----|
| 13 | 15 | 30 |
| 10 | 20 | 15 |
```
For the sample data above, your query should return the follow result:
```
| x  | y  | z  | triangle |
|----|----|----|----------|
| 13 | 15 | 30 | No       |
| 10 | 20 | 15 | Yes      |
```

## Solution
In the query, a new column `triangle` is added to show whether the three sides can form a triangle. To determine whether a triangle can be formed, check whether any two sides' sum is greater than the third side.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select x, y, z,
    case when x + y > z and x + z > y and y + z > x then 'Yes' else 'No' end as triangle
    from triangle;
```
