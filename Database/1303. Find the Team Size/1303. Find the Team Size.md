## Description

```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| employee_id   | int     |
| team_id       | int     |
+---------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the ID of each employee and their respective team.
```
Write an SQL query to find the team size of each of the employees.

Return result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Employee Table:
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_id    |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     8      |
|     2       |     8      |
|     3       |     8      |
|     4       |     7      |
|     5       |     9      |
|     6       |     9      |
+-------------+------------+
Result table:
+-------------+------------+
| employee_id | team_size  |
+-------------+------------+
|     1       |     3      |
|     2       |     3      |
|     3       |     3      |
|     4       |     1      |
|     5       |     2      |
|     6       |     2      |
+-------------+------------+
Employees with Id 1,2,3 are part of a team with team_id = 8.
Employees with Id 4 is part of a team with team_id = 7.
Employees with Id 5,6 are part of a team with team_id = 9.
```

## Solution
Join table `Employee` with itself using the field `team_id`. Then for each `employee_id`, obtain the number of entries and use it as `team_size`.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select e1.employee_id, count(*) as team_size
    from Employee e1 left join Employee e2
    on e1.team_id = e2.team_id
    group by e1.employee_id;
```
