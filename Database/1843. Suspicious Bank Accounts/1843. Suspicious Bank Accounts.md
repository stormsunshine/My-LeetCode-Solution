Write an SQL query to report the IDs of all **suspicious** bank accounts.

A bank account is **suspicious** if the **total income** exceeds the `max_income` for this account for **two or more consecutive** months. The **total income** of an account in some month is the sum of all its deposits in that month (i.e., transactions of the type `'Creditor'`).

Return the result table **in ascending order by** `transaction_id`.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Accounts table:
+------------+------------+
| account_id | max_income |
+------------+------------+
| 3          | 21000      |
| 4          | 10400      |
+------------+------------+

Transactions table:
+----------------+------------+----------+--------+---------------------+
| transaction_id | account_id | type     | amount | day                 |
+----------------+------------+----------+--------+---------------------+
| 2              | 3          | Creditor | 107100 | 2021-06-02 11:38:14 |
| 4              | 4          | Creditor | 10400  | 2021-06-20 12:39:18 |
| 11             | 4          | Debtor   | 58800  | 2021-07-23 12:41:55 |
| 1              | 4          | Creditor | 49300  | 2021-05-03 16:11:04 |
| 15             | 3          | Debtor   | 75500  | 2021-05-23 14:40:20 |
| 10             | 3          | Creditor | 102100 | 2021-06-15 10:37:16 |
| 14             | 4          | Creditor | 56300  | 2021-07-21 12:12:25 |
| 19             | 4          | Debtor   | 101100 | 2021-05-09 15:21:49 |
| 8              | 3          | Creditor | 64900  | 2021-07-26 15:09:56 |
| 7              | 3          | Creditor | 90900  | 2021-06-14 11:23:07 |
+----------------+------------+----------+--------+---------------------+

Result table:
+------------+
| account_id |
+------------+
| 3          |
+------------+

For account 3:
- In 6-2021, the user had an income of 107100 + 102100 + 90900 = 300100.
- In 7-2021, the user had an income of 64900.
We can see that the income exceeded the max income of 21000 for two consecutive months, so we include 3 in the result table.

For account 4:
- In 5-2021, the user had an income of 49300.
- In 6-2021, the user had an income of 10400.
- In 7-2021, the user had an income of 56300.
We can see that the income exceeded the max income in May and July, but not in June. Since the account did not exceed the max income for two consecutive months, we do not include it in the result table.
```

## Solution
For each `account_id`, calculate each month's total income. Then return the accounts that have at least two consecutive months with total income exceeding `max_income`.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
with t as (
    select t.account_id, date_format(day, "%Y%m01") as ym,
        sum(if(type = 'creditor', amount, 0)) as sumcred, a.max_income
    from transactions t join accounts a 
    on t.account_id = a.account_id
    group by t.account_id,ym
)
select distinct t1.account_id
    from t t1 join t t2 
    on datediff(t2.ym, t1.ym) between 28 and 31   
    and t1.account_id = t2.account_id 
    and t1.sumcred > t1.max_income and t2.sumcred > t2.max_income;
```
