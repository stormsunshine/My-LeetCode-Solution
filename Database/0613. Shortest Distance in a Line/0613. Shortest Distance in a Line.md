# 613. Shortest Distance in a Line
## Level
Easy

## Description
Table `point` holds the x coordinate of some points on x-axis in a plane, which are all integers.

Write a query to find the shortest distance between two points in these points.

```
| x   |
|-----|
| -1  |
| 0   |
| 2   |
```

The shortest distance is '1' obviously, which is from point '-1' to '0'. So the output is as below:

```
| shortest|
|---------|
| 1       |
```

**Note:** Every point is unique, which means there is no duplicates in table `point`.

**Follow-up:** What if all these points have an id and are arranged from the left most to the right most of x axis?

## Solution
Join `point` with itself, and select the minimum absolute value of differences between any two points.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select min(abs(p1.x - p2.x)) as shortest
    from point p1 join point p2
    on p1.x != p2.x;
```
