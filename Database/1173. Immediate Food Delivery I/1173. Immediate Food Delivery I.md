# 1173. Immediate Food Delivery I

## Description
Table: `Delivery`
```
+-----------------------------+---------+
| Column Name                 | Type    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
| delivery_id                 | int     |
| customer_id                 | int     |
| order_date                  | date    |
| customer_pref_delivery_date | date    |
+-----------------------------+---------+
delivery_id is the primary key of this table.
The table holds information about food delivery to customers that make orders at some date and specify a preferred delivery date (on the same order date or after it).
```

If the preferred delivery date of the customer is the same as the order date then the order is called *immediate* otherwise it's called *scheduled*.

Write an SQL query to find the percentage of immediate orders in the table, **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Delivery table:
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| delivery_id | customer_id | order_date | customer_pref_delivery_date |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+
| 1           | 1           | 2019-08-01 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 2           | 5           | 2019-08-02 | 2019-08-02                  |
| 3           | 1           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-11                  |
| 4           | 3           | 2019-08-24 | 2019-08-26                  |
| 5           | 4           | 2019-08-21 | 2019-08-22                  |
| 6           | 2           | 2019-08-11 | 2019-08-13                  |
+-------------+-------------+------------+-----------------------------+

Result table:
+----------------------+
| immediate_percentage |
+----------------------+
| 33.33                |
+----------------------+
The orders with delivery id 2 and 3 are immediate while the others are scheduled.
```

## Solution
Count the number of entries where `order_date` is equal to `customer_pref_delivery_date`, and divide the number of entries by the total number of entries. Use `round` to round the result to 2 decimal places.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select ifnull(
    round(
        (select count(*) from Delivery where order_date = customer_pref_delivery_date)
        /
        (count(delivery_id)) * 100
        , 2)
    , 0
) as immediate_percentage from Delivery;
```
