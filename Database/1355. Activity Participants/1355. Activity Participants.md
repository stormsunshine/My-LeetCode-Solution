Table: `Activities`
```

Write an SQL query to find the names of all the activities with neither maximum, nor minimum number of participants.

Return the result table in any order. Each activity in table Activities is performed by any person in the table Friends.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Friends table:
+------+--------------+---------------+
| id   | name         | activity      |
+------+--------------+---------------+
| 1    | Jonathan D.  | Eating        |
| 2    | Jade W.      | Singing       |
| 3    | Victor J.    | Singing       |
| 4    | Elvis Q.     | Eating        |
| 5    | Daniel A.    | Eating        |
| 6    | Bob B.       | Horse Riding  |
+------+--------------+---------------+

Activities table:
+------+--------------+
| id   | name         |
+------+--------------+
| 1    | Eating       |
| 2    | Singing      |
| 3    | Horse Riding |
+------+--------------+

Result table:
+--------------+
| ACTIVITY     |
+--------------+
| Singing      |
+--------------+

Eating activity is performed by 3 friends, maximum number of participants, (Jonathan D. , Elvis Q. and Daniel A.)
Horse Riding activity is performed by 1 friend, minimum number of participants, (Bob B.)
Singing is performed by 2 friends (Victor J. and Jade W.)
```

## Solution
The selection can be done only using table `Friends` without using table `Activities`. Use `order by` and `limit 1` to select the minimum count (ascending) and the maximum count (descending). Only select the activities with counts between minimum plus 1 and maximum minus 1.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select a.activity as ACTIVITY
    from (
        select activity, count(*) from Friends group by activity having count(*) between
        (select count(*) c from friends group by activity order by c asc limit 1) + 1
        and
        (select count(*) c from friends group by activity order by c desc limit 1) - 1
    ) a;
```
