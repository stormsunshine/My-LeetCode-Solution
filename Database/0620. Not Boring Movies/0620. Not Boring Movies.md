## Level
Easy

## Description
X city opened a new cinema, many people would like to go to this cinema. The cinema also gives out a poster indicating the movies¡¯ ratings and descriptions.

Please write a SQL query to output movies with an odd numbered ID and a description that is not 'boring'. Order the result by rating.

For example, table `cinema`:
```
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
|   2     | Science   |   fiction    |   8.5     |
|   3     | irish     |   boring     |   6.2     |
|   4     | Ice song  |   Fantacy    |   8.6     |
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
```
For the example above, the output should be:
```
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   id    | movie     |  description |  rating   |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
|   5     | House card|   Interesting|   9.1     |
|   1     | War       |   great 3D   |   8.9     |
+---------+-----------+--------------+-----------+
```

## Solution
To select the movies with an odd numbered ID, use condition `id % 2 = 1`. To select the movies with a description that is not 'boring', use condition `description != 'boring'`. Finally, order the query result by `rating` in descending order.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select * from cinema where id % 2 = 1 and description != 'boring' order by rating desc;
```
