## Description
Table: `Teams`
```
+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    |
+----------------+---------+
| team_id        | int     |
| team_name      | varchar |
+----------------+---------+
team_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about one team in the league.
```

Table: `Matches`
```
+-----------------+---------+
| Column Name     | Type    |
+-----------------+---------+
| home_team_id    | int     |
| away_team_id    | int     |
| home_team_goals | int     |
| away_team_goals | int     |
+-----------------+---------+
(home_team_id, away_team_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about one match.
home_team_goals is the number of goals scored by the home team.
away_team_goals is the number of goals scored by the away team.
The winner of the match is the team with the higher number of goals.
```

Write an SQL query to report the statistics of the league. The statistics should be built using the played matches where the **winning** team gets **three points** and the **losing** team gets **no points**. If a match ends with a **draw**, both teams get **one point**.

Each row of the result table should contain:

* `team_name` - The name of the team in the `Teams` table.
* `matches_played` - The number of matches played as either a home or away team.
* `points` - The total points the team has so far.
* `goal_for` - The total number of goals scored by the team across all matches.
* `goal_against` - The total number of goals scored by opponent teams against this team across all matches.
* `goal_diff` - The result of `goal_for - goal_against`.

Return the result table **in descending order by** `points`. If two or more teams have the same `points`, order them **in descending order by** `goal_diff`. If there is still a tie, order them by `team_name` in **lexicographical order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Teams table:
+---------+-----------+
| team_id | team_name |
+---------+-----------+
| 1       | Ajax      |
| 4       | Dortmund  |
| 6       | Arsenal   |
+---------+-----------+

Matches table:
+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| home_team_id | away_team_id | home_team_goals | away_team_goals |
+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+
| 1            | 4            | 0               | 1               |
| 1            | 6            | 3               | 3               |
| 4            | 1            | 5               | 2               |
| 6            | 1            | 0               | 0               |
+--------------+--------------+-----------------+-----------------+


Result table:
+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+
| team_name | matches_played | points | goal_for | goal_against | goal_diff |
+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+
| Dortmund  | 2              | 6      | 6        | 2            | 4         |
| Arsenal   | 2              | 2      | 3        | 3            | 0         |
| Ajax      | 4              | 2      | 5        | 9            | -4        |
+-----------+----------------+--------+----------+--------------+-----------+

Ajax (team_id=1) played 4 matches: 2 losses and 2 draws. Total points = 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 = 2.
Dortmund (team_id=4) played 2 matches: 2 wins. Total points = 3 + 3 = 6.
Arsenal (team_id=6) played 2 matches: 2 draws. Total points = 1 + 1 = 2.
Dortmund is the first team in the table. Ajax and Arsenal have the same points, but since Arsenal has a higher goal_diff than Ajax, Arsenal comes before Ajax in the table.
```

## Solution
For each team, calculate the points it gains as `home_team` and as `away_team` respectively, and calculate the values of the corresponding fields.
