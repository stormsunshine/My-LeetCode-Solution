# 612. Shortest Distance in a Plane
## Level
Medium

## Description
Table `point_2d` holds the coordinates (x,y) of some unique points (more than two) in a plane.

Write a query to find the shortest distance between these points rounded to 2 decimals.

```
| x  | y  |
|----|----|
| -1 | -1 |
| 0  | 0  |
| -1 | -2 |
```

The shortest distance is 1.00 from point (-1,-1) to (-1,2). So the output should be:

```
| shortest |
|----------|
| 1.00     |
```

**Note:** The longest distance among all the points are less than 10000.

## Solution
Join `point_2d` with itself, and select the minimum absolute value of differences between any two points. To find the shortest distance rounded to 2 decimals, use `convert`.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select convert(min(sqrt(power(p1.x - p2.x, 2) + power(p1.y - p2.y, 2))), decimal(18, 2)) as shortest
    from point_2d p1 join point_2d p2
    on p1.x != p2.x or p1.y != p2.y;
```
