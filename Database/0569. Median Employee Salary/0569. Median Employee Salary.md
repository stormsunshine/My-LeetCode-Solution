Write a SQL query to find the median salary of each company. Bonus points if you can solve it without using any built-in SQL functions.

|Id   | Company    | Salary |
+-----+------------+--------+
|5    | A          | 451    |
|6    | A          | 513    |
|12   | B          | 234    |
|9    | B          | 1154   |
|14   | C          | 2645   |

## Solution
Use the definition of median. If the number of employees is odd, then there is only one median, and the number of employees with a higher salary equals the number of employees with a lower salary. If the number of employees is even, then there are two medians, and for each median, the absolute difference between the number of employees with a higher salary equals the number of employees with a lower salary is 1.

# Write your MySQL query statement below
select e1.id, e1.Company, e1.Salary
    from Employee e1, Employee e2
    where e1.Company = e2.Company
    group by e1.Company, e1.Salary
    having sum(
        case when e1.Salary = e2.Salary then 1 else 0 end
    ) >= abs(sum(sign(e1.Salary - e2.Salary)))
    order by e1.Id;
```
