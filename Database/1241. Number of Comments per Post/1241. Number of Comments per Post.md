## Description
Table: `Submissions`
```
+---------------+----------+
| Column Name   | Type     |
+---------------+----------+
| sub_id        | int      |
| parent_id     | int      |
+---------------+----------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
Each row can be a post or comment on the post.
parent_id is null for posts.
parent_id for comments is sub_id for another post in the table.
```

Write an SQL query to find number of comments per each post.

Result table should contain `post_id` and its corresponding `number_of_comments`, and must be sorted by `post_id` in ascending order.

`Submissions` may contain duplicate comments. You should count the number of **unique comments** per post.

`Submissions` may contain duplicate posts. You should treat them as one post.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Submissions table:
+---------+------------+
| sub_id  | parent_id  |
+---------+------------+
| 1       | Null       |
| 2       | Null       |
| 1       | Null       |
| 12      | Null       |
| 3       | 1          |
| 5       | 2          |
| 3       | 1          |
| 4       | 1          |
| 9       | 1          |
| 10      | 2          |
| 6       | 7          |
+---------+------------+

Result table:
+---------+--------------------+
| post_id | number_of_comments |
+---------+--------------------+
| 1       | 3                  |
| 2       | 2                  |
| 12      | 0                  |
+---------+--------------------+

The post with id 1 has three comments in the table with id 3, 4 and 9. The comment with id 3 is repeated in the table, we counted it only once.
The post with id 2 has two comments in the table with id 5 and 10.
The post with id 12 has no comments in the table.
The comment with id 6 is a comment on a deleted post with id 7 so we ignored it.
```

## Solution
Use `left join` to obtain each post's comments and then count the number of comments per post.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select post_id, count(sub_id) as number_of_comments
    from(
        select distinct a.sub_id as post_id, b.sub_id as sub_id
            from Submissions a left join Submissions b
            on a.sub_id = b.parent_id
            where a.parent_id is Null
    ) as number
    group by post_id;
```
