Write an SQL query to find the IDs of the users who visited without making any transactions and the number of times they made these types of visits.

Return the result table sorted in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Visits
+----------+-------------+
| visit_id | customer_id |
+----------+-------------+
| 1        | 23          |
| 2        | 9           |
| 4        | 30          |
| 5        | 54          |
| 6        | 96          |
| 7        | 54          |
| 8        | 54          |
+----------+-------------+

Transactions
+----------------+----------+--------+
| transaction_id | visit_id | amount |
+----------------+----------+--------+
| 2              | 5        | 310    |
| 3              | 5        | 300    |
| 9              | 5        | 200    |
| 12             | 1        | 910    |
| 13             | 2        | 970    |
+----------------+----------+--------+

Result table:
+-------------+----------------+
| customer_id | count_no_trans |
+-------------+----------------+
| 54          | 2              |
| 30          | 1              |
| 96          | 1              |
+-------------+----------------+
Customer with id = 23 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 12.
Customer with id = 9 visited the mall once and made one transaction during the visit with id = 13.
Customer with id = 30 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
Customer with id = 54 visited the mall three times. During 2 visits they did not make any transactions, and during one visit they made 3 transactions.
Customer with id = 96 visited the mall once and did not make any transactions.
As we can see, users with IDs 30 and 96 visited the mall one time without making any transactions. Also user 54 visited the mall twice and did not make any transactions.
```

## Solution
For each customer, count the number of visits in table `Visits`. Join tables `Visits` and `Transactions` using `visit_id` to find the customers who visited but did not make any transactions. Finally, group the result by `customer_id`.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select customer_id, count(customer_id) as count_no_trans
    from Visits left join Transactions on Visits.visit_id = Transactions.visit_id
    where Transactions.visit_id is null
    group by customer_id;
```
