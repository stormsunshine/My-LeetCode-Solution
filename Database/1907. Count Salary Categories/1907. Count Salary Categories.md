## Description
Table: `Accounts`
```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| account_id  | int  |
| income      | int  |
+-------------+------+
account_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about the monthly income for one bank account.
```

Write an SQL query to report the number of bank accounts of each salary category. The salary categories are:

* `"Low Salary"`: All the salaries **strictly less** than `$20000`.
* `"Average Salary"`: All the salaries in the **inclusive** range `[$20000, $50000]`.
* `"High Salary"`: All the salaries **strictly greater** than `$50000`.

The result table **must* contain all three categories. If there are no accounts in a category, then report `0`. Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

```
Accounts table:
+------------+--------+
| account_id | income |
+------------+--------+
| 3          | 108939 |
| 2          | 12747  |
| 8          | 87709  |
| 6          | 91796  |
+------------+--------+

Result table:
+----------------+----------------+
| category       | accounts_count |
+----------------+----------------+
| Low Salary     | 1              |
| Average Salary | 0              |
| High Salary    | 3              |
+----------------+----------------+
```

## Solution
First, create `t` as the union of all categories `Low Salary`, `Average Salary` and `High Salary`. Next, convert the values of `income` into the corresponding categories. Finally, use `left join` to combine the query results and use `ifnull` to return 0 for categories with no accounts.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select t.category, ifnull(a.cnt, 0) as accounts_count
    from (
        select 'Low Salary' category 
        union 
        select 'Average Salary' 
        union 
        select 'High Salary'
    ) as t
    left join (
        select
            case when income < 20000 then 'Low Salary'
                 when income > 50000 then 'High Salary'
                 else 'Average Salary' end
            as category,
            count(1) as cnt
        from Accounts
        group by 1
    ) as a
    on t.category = a.category;
```
