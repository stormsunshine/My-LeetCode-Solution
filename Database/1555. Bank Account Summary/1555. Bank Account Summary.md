Leetcode Bank (LCB) helps its coders in making virtual payments. Our bank records all transactions in the table *Transaction*, we want to find out the current balance of all users and check wheter they have breached their credit limit (If their current credit is less than 0).

Write an SQL query to report.

* `user_id`
* `user_name`
* `credit`, current balance after performing transactions.  
* `credit_limit_breached`, check credit_limit ("Yes" or "No")

Return the result table in **any** order.

The query result format is in the following example.

```
Users table:
+------------+--------------+-------------+
| user_id    | user_name    | credit      |
+------------+--------------+-------------+
| 1          | Moustafa     | 100         |
| 2          | Jonathan     | 200         |
| 3          | Winston      | 10000       |
| 4          | Luis         | 800         | 
+------------+--------------+-------------+

Transaction table:
+------------+------------+------------+----------+---------------+
| trans_id   | paid_by    | paid_to    | amount   | transacted_on |
+------------+------------+------------+----------+---------------+
| 1          | 1          | 3          | 400      | 2020-08-01    |
| 2          | 3          | 2          | 500      | 2020-08-02    |
| 3          | 2          | 1          | 200      | 2020-08-03    |
+------------+------------+------------+----------+---------------+

Result table:
+------------+------------+------------+-----------------------+
| user_id    | user_name  | credit     | credit_limit_breached |
+------------+------------+------------+-----------------------+
| 1          | Moustafa   | -100       | Yes                   | 
| 2          | Jonathan   | 500        | No                    |
| 3          | Winston    | 9900       | No                    |
| 4          | Luis       | 800        | No                    |
+------------+------------+------------+-----------------------+
Moustafa paid $400 on "2020-08-01" and received $200 on "2020-08-03", credit (100 -400 +200) = -$100
Jonathan received $500 on "2020-08-02" and paid $200 on "2020-08-08", credit (200 +500 -200) = $500
Winston received $400 on "2020-08-01" and paid $500 on "2020-08-03", credit (10000 +400 -500) = $9900
Luis didn't received any transfer, credit = $800
```

## Solution
Use table `Users` to left join table `Transaction` twice to obtain total `paid_by` amount and total `paid_to` amount, respectively. Then use the two amounts and the original `credit` amount to calculate each user's total credit, and use the total credit to check whether each user's credit limit is breached.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select user_id, user_name, credit - ifnull(t1.amount, 0) + ifnull(t2.amount, 0) as credit, if(credit - ifnull(t1.amount, 0) + ifnull(t2.amount, 0) < 0, 'Yes', 'No') as credit_limit_breached
    from Users
    left join (select paid_by, sum(amount) as amount from Transaction group by paid_by) t1 on Users.user_id = t1.paid_by
    left join (select paid_to, sum(amount) as amount from Transaction group by paid_to) t2 on Users.user_id = t2.paid_to;
```
