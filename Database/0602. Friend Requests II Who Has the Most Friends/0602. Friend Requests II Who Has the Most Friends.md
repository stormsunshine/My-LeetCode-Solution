## Level
Medium

## Description
In social network like Facebook or Twitter, people send friend requests and accept others' requests as well.

Table `request_accepted`
```
+--------------+-------------+------------+
| requester_id | accepter_id | accept_date|
|--------------|-------------|------------|
| 1            | 2           | 2016_06-03 |
| 1            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 2            | 3           | 2016-06-08 |
| 3            | 4           | 2016-06-09 |
+--------------+-------------+------------+
This table holds the data of friend acceptance, while requester_id and accepter_id both are the id of a person.
```

Write a query to find the the people who has most friends and the most friends number under the following rules:

* It is guaranteed there is only 1 people having the most friends.
* The friend request could only been accepted once, which mean there is no multiple records with the same **requester_id** and **accepter_id** value.

For the sample data above, the result is:
```
Result table:
+------+------+
| id   | num  |
|------|------|
| 3    | 3    |
+------+------+
The person with id '3' is a friend of people '1', '2' and '4', so he has 3 friends in total, which is the most number than any others.
```

**Follow-up:**

In the real world, multiple people could have the same most number of friends, can you find all these people in this case?

## Solution
The person that has the most friends has the maximum number of occurrences in `requester_id` and `accepter_id`, so use `union all` to obtain all the values in `requester_id` and `accepter_id`, including duplicates. Then select the corresponding `id` and the count of the occurrences of `id` using `group by`. Use `order by` and `limit` to remain the entry with the maximum number of friends.


```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select id, count(*) as num from (
    select requester_id as id from request_accepted
    union all
    select accepter_id from request_accepted
) as friends_count
group by id
order by num desc limit 1;
```
