Write an SQL query to find the average for daily percentage of posts that got removed after being reported as spam, **rounded to 2 decimal places**.

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Actions table:
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| user_id | post_id | action_date | action | extra  |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | view   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | like   | null   |
| 1       | 1       | 2019-07-01  | share  | null   |
| 2       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 2       | 2       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | view   | null   |
| 3       | 4       | 2019-07-04  | report | spam   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | view   | null   |
| 4       | 3       | 2019-07-02  | report | spam   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-03  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 2       | 2019-07-03  | report | racism |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-03  | view   | null   |
| 5       | 5       | 2019-07-03  | report | racism |
+---------+---------+-------------+--------+--------+

Removals table:
+---------+-------------+
| post_id | remove_date |
+---------+-------------+
| 2       | 2019-07-20  |
| 3       | 2019-07-18  |
+---------+-------------+

Result table:
+-----------------------+
| average_daily_percent |
+-----------------------+
| 75.00                 |
+-----------------------+
The percentage for 2019-07-04 is 50% because only one post of two spam reported posts was removed.
The percentage for 2019-07-02 is 100% because one post was reported as spam and it was removed.
The other days had no spam reports so the average is (50 + 100) / 2 = 75%
Note that the output is only one number and that we do not care about the remove dates.
```

## Solution
To find the average, use `ifnull`. To round the result to 2 decimal places, use `round`. Join the tables `Actions` and `Removals`. Count the number of posts being reported as spam from table `Actions` where `extra` column is `'spam'`. Count the number of removed posted from table `Removals`.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select ifnull(round(sum(remove_count / spam_count * 100) / count(distinct action_date), 2), 0)
    as average_daily_percent
    from (
        select action_date, count(distinct a.post_id) as spam_count, count(distinct r.post_id) as remove_count
            from Actions a left join Removals r on a.post_id = r.post_id
            where a.extra = 'spam'
            group by a.action_date
    ) as a;
```
