Write an SQL query to report the **percentage** of working drivers (working_percentage) for each month of **2020** where:

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/31/codecogseqn.png)

**Note** that if the number of available drivers during a month is zero, we consider the `working_percentage` to be `0`.

Return the result table ordered by `month` in **ascending** order, where `month` is the month's number (January is `1`, February is `2`, etc.). Round `working_percentage` to the nearest **2 decimal places**.

The query result format is in the following example.

By the end of January --> two active drivers (10, 8) and no accepted rides. The percentage is 0%.
By the end of February --> three active drivers (10, 8, 5) and no accepted rides. The percentage is 0%.
By the end of March --> four active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7) and one accepted ride by driver (10). The percentage is (1 / 4) * 100 = 25%.
By the end of April --> four active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7) and no accepted rides. The percentage is 0%.
By the end of May --> five active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7, 4) and no accepted rides. The percentage is 0%.
By the end of June --> five active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7, 4) and one accepted ride by driver (10). The percentage is (1 / 5) * 100 = 20%.
By the end of July --> five active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7, 4) and one accepted ride by driver (8). The percentage is (1 / 5) * 100 = 20%.
By the end of August --> five active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7, 4) and one accepted ride by driver (7). The percentage is (1 / 5) * 100 = 20%.
By the end of Septemeber --> five active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7, 4) and no accepted rides. The percentage is 0%.
By the end of October --> six active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7, 4, 1) and no accepted rides. The percentage is 0%.
By the end of November --> six active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7, 4, 1) and two accepted rides by two different drivers (1, 7). The percentage is (2 / 6) * 100 = 33.33%.
By the end of December --> six active drivers (10, 8, 5, 7, 4, 1) and one accepted ride by driver (4). The percentage is (1 / 6) * 100 = 16.67%.

## Solution
Create three temp tables for months, the number of drivers in each month and the number of active drivers in each month. Then calculate the percentage of working drivers for each month accordingly.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select t1.month, ifnull(round(ifnull(active_rides, 0) / sum(ifnull(dcnt, 0)) over (order by t1.month) * 100,2), 0) working_percentage from (
    select month from (
        select 1 month union select 2 union select 3 union select 4 union
        select 5 union select 6 union select 7 union select 8 union
        select 9 union select 10 union select 11 union select 12) tmp
    order by month
) t1 left join (
    select if (year(join_date) < '2020', 1, month(join_date)) month, count(*) dcnt
        from Drivers 
        where year(join_date) <= '2020' 
        group by month
) t2 on t1.month = t2.month
left join (
    select month(r.requested_at) month, count(distinct driver_id) active_rides
        from AcceptedRides a 
        left join Rides r on a.ride_id = r.ride_id
        and year(r.requested_at) = '2020'
        group by month(r.requested_at)
) t3 on t1.month = t3.month;
```
