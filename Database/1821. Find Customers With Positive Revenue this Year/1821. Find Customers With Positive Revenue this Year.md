## Description
Table: `Customers`
```
+--------------+------+
| Column Name  | Type |
+--------------+------+
| customer_id  | int  |
| year         | int  |
| revenue      | int  |
+--------------+------+
(customer_id, year) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the customer ID and the revenue of customers in different years.
Note that this revenue can be negative.
```

Write an SQL query to report the customers with **postive revenue** in the year 2021.

Return the result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Customers
+-------------+------+---------+
| customer_id | year | revenue |
+-------------+------+---------+
| 1           | 2018 | 50      |
| 1           | 2021 | 30      |
| 1           | 2020 | 70      |
| 2           | 2021 | -50     |
| 3           | 2018 | 10      |
| 3           | 2016 | 50      |
| 4           | 2021 | 20      |
+-------------+------+---------+

Result table:
+-------------+
| customer_id |
+-------------+
| 1           |
| 4           |
+-------------+

Customer 1 has revenue equal to 30 in year 2021.
Customer 2 has revenue equal to -50 in year 2021.
Customer 3 has no revenue in year 2021.
Customer 4 has revenue equal to 20 in year 2021.
Thus only customers 1 and 4 have postive revenue in year 2021.
```

## Solution
Simply select the entries where `year` is 2021 and `revenue` is greater than 0. Select the values of `customer_id` as the query result.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select customer_id from Customers where year = '2021' and revenue > 0;
```
