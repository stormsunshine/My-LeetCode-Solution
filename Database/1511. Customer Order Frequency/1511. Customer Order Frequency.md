| 1            | Winston    |
+--------------+------------+

```

## Solution
Join the tables `Customers`, `Orders` and `Product` using the common fields. Use `case` statements and `left` statements to calculate the total spent amount of each customer in each month of June and July 2020.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select c.customer_id, c.name
    from Customers c join Orders o on c.customer_id = o.customer_id
    join Product p on o.product_id = p.product_id
    group by c.customer_id, c.name
    having
    sum(case when left(o.order_date, 7) = '2020-06' then p.price * o.quantity else 0 end) >= 100
    and
    sum(case when left(o.order_date, 7) = '2020-07' then p.price * o.quantity else 0 end) >= 100;
```
