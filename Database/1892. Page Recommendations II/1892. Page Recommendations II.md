You are implementing a page recommendation system for a social media website. Your system will **recommend** a page to `user_id` if the page is **liked** by **at least one** friend of `user_id` and is **not liked** by `user_id`.

Write an SQL query to find all the possible **page recommendations** for every user. Each recommendation should appear as a row in the result table with these columns:

* `user_id`: The ID of the user that your system is making the recommendation to.
* `page_id`: The ID of the page that will be recommended to user_id.
* `friends_likes`: The number of the friends of user_id that like page_id.

Return result table in **any order**.

The query result format is in the following example:

```
Friendship table:
+----------+----------+
| user1_id | user2_id |
+----------+----------+
| 1        | 2        |
| 1        | 3        |
| 1        | 4        |
| 2        | 3        |
| 2        | 4        |
| 2        | 5        |
| 6        | 1        |
+----------+----------+
 
Likes table:
+---------+---------+
| user_id | page_id |
+---------+---------+
| 1       | 88      |
| 2       | 23      |
| 3       | 24      |
| 4       | 56      |

| 3       | 23      | 1             |
| 4       | 88      | 1             |
| 4       | 77      | 1             |
| 4       | 23      | 1             |
| 5       | 77      | 1             |

Take user 1 as an example:
  - User 1 is friends with users 2, 3, 4, and 6.
  - Recommended pages are 23 (user 2 liked it), 24 (user 3 liked it), 56 (user 3 liked it), 33 (user 6 liked it), and 77 (user 2 and user 3 liked it).
  - Note that page 88 is not recommended because user 1 already liked it.

Another example is user 6:
  - User 6 is friends with user 1.
  - User 1 only liked page 88, but user 6 already liked it. Hence, user 6 has no recommendations.

You can recommend pages for users 2, 3, 4, and 5 using a similar process.
```

## Solution
Select two users `user1_id` and `user2_id` from `Friendship`, and select the pages liked by `user2_id` but not liked by `user1_id`. Use `inner join` to obtain the pages recommended to `user1_id`.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select f.user1_id as user_id, l.page_id, count(*) as friends_likes
    from (
        select user1_id, user2_id from Friendship union select user2_id, user1_id from Friendship
    ) as f
    inner join Likes l
    on f.user2_id = l.user_id 
    where not exists (
        select * from Likes where user_id = f.user1_id and page_id = l.page_id
    )
    group by f.user1_id, l.page_id;
```
