## Description
Table: `Sales`
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| sale_date     | date    |
| fruit         | enum    | 
| sold_num      | int     | 
+---------------+---------+
(sale_date,fruit) is the primary key for this table.
This table contains the sales of "apples" and "oranges" sold each day.
```

Write an SQL query to report the difference between number of **apples** and **oranges** sold each day.

Return the result table **ordered** by sale_date in format ('YYYY-MM-DD').

The query result format is in the following example:
```
Sales table:
+------------+------------+-------------+
| sale_date  | fruit      | sold_num    |
+------------+------------+-------------+
| 2020-05-01 | apples     | 10          |
| 2020-05-01 | oranges    | 8           |
| 2020-05-02 | apples     | 15          |
| 2020-05-02 | oranges    | 15          |
| 2020-05-03 | apples     | 20          |
| 2020-05-03 | oranges    | 0           |
| 2020-05-04 | apples     | 15          |
| 2020-05-04 | oranges    | 16          |
+------------+------------+-------------+

Result table:
+------------+--------------+
| sale_date  | diff         |
+------------+--------------+
| 2020-05-01 | 2            |
| 2020-05-02 | 0            |
| 2020-05-03 | 20           |
| 2020-05-04 | -1           |
+------------+--------------+

Day 2020-05-01, 10 apples and 8 oranges were sold (Difference  10 - 8 = 2).
Day 2020-05-02, 15 apples and 15 oranges were sold (Difference 15 - 15 = 0).
Day 2020-05-03, 20 apples and 0 oranges were sold (Difference 20 - 0 = 20).
Day 2020-05-04, 15 apples and 16 oranges were sold (Difference 15 - 16 = -1).
```

## Solution
Use `sum` statement and `if` statement such that `sold_num` is added to `diff` if `fruit = 'apples'` or `-sold_num` is added to `diff` if `fruit = 'oranges'`. Use `group by sale_date` and `order by sale_date` to obtain the results for each date.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select sale_date, sum(if(fruit = 'apples', sold_num, -sold_num)) as diff
    from Sales
    group by sale_date
    order by sale_date;
```
