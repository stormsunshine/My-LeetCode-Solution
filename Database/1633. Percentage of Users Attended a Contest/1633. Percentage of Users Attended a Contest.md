## Description
Table: `Users`
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| user_id     | int     |
| user_name   | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
user_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the name and the id of a user.
```

Table: `Register`
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| contest_id  | int     |
| user_id     | int     |
+-------------+---------+
(contest_id, user_id) is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table contains the id of a user and the contest they registered into.
```

Write an SQL query to find the percentage of the users registered in each contest rounded to two decimals.

Return the result table ordered by `percentage` in **descending order**. In case of a tie, order it by `contest_id` in **ascending order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

```
Users table:
+---------+-----------+
| user_id | user_name |
+---------+-----------+
| 6       | Alice     |
| 2       | Bob       |
| 7       | Alex      |
+---------+-----------+

Register table:
+------------+---------+
| contest_id | user_id |
+------------+---------+
| 215        | 6       |
| 209        | 2       |
| 208        | 2       |
| 210        | 6       |
| 208        | 6       |
| 209        | 7       |
| 209        | 6       |
| 215        | 7       |
| 208        | 7       |
| 210        | 2       |
| 207        | 2       |
| 210        | 7       |
+------------+---------+

Result table:
+------------+------------+
| contest_id | percentage |
+------------+------------+
| 208        | 100.0      |
| 209        | 100.0      |
| 210        | 100.0      |
| 215        | 66.67      |
| 207        | 33.33      |
+------------+------------+
All the users registered in contests 208, 209, and 210. The percentage is 100% and we sort them in the answer table by contest_id in ascending order.
Alice and Alex registered in contest 215 and the percentage is ((2/3) * 100) = 66.67%
Bob registered in contest 207 and the percentage is ((1/3) * 100) = 33.33%
```

## Solution
For each contest, calculate the percentage by calculating the number of users registered in the contest divided by the total number of users. Use `round` to round the result to two decimals. Sort the result table by `percentage` in descending order and then by `contest_id` in ascending order.
```
# Write your MySQL query statement below
select contest_id, ifnull(round(count(*) / (select count(user_id) from Users) * 100, 2), 0) as percentage
    from Register
    group by contest_id
    order by percentage desc, contest_id;
```
