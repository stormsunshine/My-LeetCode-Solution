# 1375. Bulb Switcher III
## Level
Medium

## Description
There is a room with n bulbs, numbered from `1` to `n`, arranged in a row from left to right. Initially, all the bulbs are turned off.

At moment *k* (for *k* from `0` to `n - 1`), we turn on the `light[k]` bulb. A bulb **change color to blue** only if it is on and all the previous bulbs (to the left) are turned on too.

Return the number of moments in which **all turned on** bulbs **are blue**.

**Example 1:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/02/29/sample_2_1725.png)

**Input:** light = [2,1,3,5,4]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 1, 2 and 4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** light = [3,2,4,1,5]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 3, and 4 (index-0).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** light = [4,1,2,3]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** All bulbs turned on, are blue at the moment 3 (index-0).
Bulb 4th changes to blue at the moment 3.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** light = [2,1,4,3,6,5]

**Output:** 3

**Example 5:**

**Input:** light = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

**Output:** 6

**Constraints:**

* `n == light.length`
* `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
* `light` is a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`

## Solution
The objective of this problem is to find the number of moments such that all the bulbs from the leftmost bulb to the rightmost turned on bulb are turned on. At the last moment, all bulbs are turned on, so the last moment is a moment that meets the requirement.

For moments 0 to `n - 2`, how to find which bulbs are turned on? Think of the process in the reversing order. That is, at moment `k - 1` where `0 <= k < n`, the `light[k]` bulb is turned off, and the maximum index (1-based) of the consecutive turned on bulbs is at most `light[k] - 1`. If the maximum index equals `k`, then the moment meets the requirement. Count such moments and return.
