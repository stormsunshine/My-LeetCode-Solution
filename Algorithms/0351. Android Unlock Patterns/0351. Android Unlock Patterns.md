# 351. Android Unlock Patterns
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an Android **3x3** key lock screen and two integers **m** and **n**, where 1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 9, count the total number of unlock patterns of the Android lock screen, which consist of minimum of **m** keys and maximum **n** keys.

**Rules for a valid pattern:**

1. Each pattern must connect at least **m** keys and at most **n** keys.
2. All the keys must be distinct.
3. If the line connecting two consecutive keys in the pattern passes through any other keys, the other keys must have previously selected in the pattern. No jumps through non selected key is allowed.
4. The order of keys used matters.

**Explanation:**
```
| 1 | 2 | 3 |
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |
```
**Invalid move:** `4 - 1 - 3 - 6`

Line 1 - 3 passes through key 2 which had not been selected in the pattern.

**Invalid move:** `4 - 1 - 9 - 2`

Line 1 - 9 passes through key 5 which had not been selected in the pattern.

**Valid move:** `2 - 4 - 1 - 3 - 6`

Line 1 - 3 is valid because it passes through key 2, which had been selected in the pattern

**Valid move:** `6 - 5 - 4 - 1 - 9 - 2`

Line 1 - 9 is valid because it passes through key 5, which had been selected in the pattern.

**Example:**

**Input:** m = 1, n = 1

**Output:** 9

## Solution
For `i` from `m` to `n`, calculate the number of patterns that consist of `i` keys, and calculate the sum of the numbers of patterns to get the answer.

To calculate the number of patterns that consist of `i` keys, use backtrack. At each step, select a key that has not been used and is valid, which means selecting the key won't conflict with the rules for a valid pattern. Repeat the process until the pattern contains up to `i` keys.
