# 1781. Sum of Beauty of All Substrings
## Level
Medium

## Description
The **beauty** of a string is the difference in frequencies between the most frequent and least frequent characters.

* For example, the beauty of `"abaacc"` is `3 - 1 = 2`.

Given a string `s`, return *the sum of **beauty** of all of its substrings*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "aabcb"

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** The substrings with non-zero beauty are ["aab","aabc","aabcb","abcb","bcb"], each with beauty equal to 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "aabcbaa"

**Output:** 17

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 500`
* `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Solution
Loop over `i` from 0 to `s.length() - 1`. For each `i`, maintain a tree map and loop over `j` from `i` to `s.length() - 1`. For `s.substring(i, j + 1)`, store the frequencies of each character, and store the frequencies in the tree map. Use the tree map's last key and first key to get the maximum frequency and the minimum frequency, and to calculate the beauty of the substring. Finally, return the sum of beauty of all the substrings of `s`.
