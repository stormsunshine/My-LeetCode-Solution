# 1780. Check if Number is a Sum of Powers of Three
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an integer `n`, return `true` *if it is possible to represent n as the sum of distinct powers of three*. Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `y` is a power of three if there exists an integer `x` such that `y == 3^x`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 12

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** 12 = 3^1 + 3^2

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 91

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** 91 = 3^0 + 3^2 + 3^4

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 21

**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^7`

## Solution
The integer `n` can always be converted into a base three representation. Each digit in base three representation is 0, 1 or 2. To represent `n` as the sum of distinct powers of three, each digit in base three representation must be 0 or 1.

In this problem, we do not actually convert `n` into a base three representation. We only need to calculate the digits and we do not care the order of the digits. Therefore, while `n > 0`, calculate the `n % 3` each time and if a remainder 2 is found, return `false`. Otherwise, let `n = n / 3` and repeat the process until `n` becomes 0. If `n` becomes 0 without any remainder 2 met, return `true`.
