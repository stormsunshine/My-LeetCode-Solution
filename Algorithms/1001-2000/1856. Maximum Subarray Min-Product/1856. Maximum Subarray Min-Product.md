# 1856. Maximum Subarray Min-Product
## Level
Medium

## Description
The **min-product** of an array is equal to the **minimum value** in the array **multiplied by** the array's **sum**.

* For example, the array [3,2,5] (minimum value is 2) has a min-product of 2 * (3+2+5) = 2 * 10 = 20.

Given an array of integers `nums`, return *the **maximum min-product** of any **non-empty subarray** of `nums`*. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

Note that the min-product should be maximized **before** performing the modulo operation. Testcases are generated such that the maximum min-product **without** modulo will fit in a **64-bit signed integer**.

A **subarray** is a **contiguous** part of an array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,2]

**Output:** 14

**Explanation:** The maximum min-product is achieved with the subarray [2,3,2] (minimum value is 2).

2 * (2+3+2) = 2 * 7 = 14.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,3,1,2]

**Output:** 18

**Explanation:** The maximum min-product is achieved with the subarray [3,3] (minimum value is 3).

3 * (3+3) = 3 * 6 = 18.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [3,1,5,6,4,2]

**Output:** 60

**Explanation:** The maximum min-product is achieved with the subarray [5,6,4] (minimum value is 4).

4 * (5+6+4) = 4 * 15 = 60.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^7`

## Solution
First, calculate the prefix sums of `nums`, which can be used to calculate range sums effectively.

Then, use monotonic stack to find the left boundary and the right boundary of each `nums[i]`. That is, `left[i]` is the rightmost index such that `left[i] < i` and `nums[left[i]] > nums[i]`, and `right[i]` is the leftmost index such that `right[i] > i` and `nums[right[i]] > nums[i]`. Then for each `0 <= i < nums.length`, the product that has `nums[i]` as the minimum value is the range sum from `left[i] + 1` to `right[i] - 1` multiplied by `nums[i]`. Loop over `i` from 0 to `nums.length - 1` to obtain the maximum subarray min-product.
