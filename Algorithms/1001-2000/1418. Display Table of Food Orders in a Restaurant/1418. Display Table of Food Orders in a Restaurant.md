## Level
Medium

## Description
Given the array `orders`, which represents the orders that customers have done in a restaurant. More specifically `orders[i]=[customerName_i,tableNumber_i,foodItem_i]` where `customerName_i` is the name of the customer, `tableNumber_i` is the table customer sit at, and `foodItem_i` is the item customer orders.

*Return the restaurant's "**display table**".* The "**display table**" is a table whose row entries denote how many of each food item each table ordered. The first column is the table number and the remaining columns correspond to each food item in alphabetical order. The first row should be a header whose first column is ¡°Table¡±, followed by the names of the food items. Note that the customer names are not part of the table. Additionally, the rows should be sorted in numerically increasing order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: orders = [["David","3","Ceviche"],["Corina","10","Beef Burrito"],["David","3","Fried Chicken"],["Carla","5","Water"],["Carla","5","Ceviche"],["Rous","3","Ceviche"]]
Output: [["Table","Beef Burrito","Ceviche","Fried Chicken","Water"],["3","0","2","1","0"],["5","0","1","0","1"],["10","1","0","0","0"]] 
Explanation:
The displaying table looks like:
Table,Beef Burrito,Ceviche,Fried Chicken,Water
3    ,0           ,2      ,1            ,0
5    ,0           ,1      ,0            ,1
10   ,1           ,0      ,0            ,0
For the table 3: David orders "Ceviche" and "Fried Chicken", and Rous orders "Ceviche".
For the table 5: Carla orders "Water" and "Ceviche".
For the table 10: Corina orders "Beef Burrito". 
```

Output: [["Table","Bean Burrito","Beef Burrito","Soda"],["2","1","1","1"]]
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= orders.length <= 5 * 10^4`
* `orders[i].length == 3`
* `1 <= customerNamei.length, foodItemi.length <= 20`
* `customerName_i` and `foodItem_i` consist of lowercase and uppercase English letters and the space character.
* `tableNumber_i` is a valid integer between `1` and `500`.

## Solution
Use a map to store each table and the orders of the table, where the orders are also stored in a map. The orders map contains each item and the count. Use a set to store all items that exist at least once. Loop over `orders`. For each order, obtain the table number and the item, and update the table's orders map using the item. After all orders are checked, obtain all the items and sort them, and combine "Table" and all the items to form the header. Then for each table, obtain all the orders of the table, and set the counts of the items. Sort the tables' display list according to the table numbers. Then add each table's display list to the result list.
