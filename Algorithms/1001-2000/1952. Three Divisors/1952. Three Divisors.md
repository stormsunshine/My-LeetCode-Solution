# 1952. Three Divisors
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an integer `n`, return *`true` if `n` has exactly three positive divisors. Otherwise, return `false`*.

An integer `m` is a **divisor** of `n` if there exists an integer `k` such that `n = k * m`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 2

**Output:** false

**Explantion:** 2 has only two divisors: 1 and 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 4

**Output:** true

**Explantion:** 4 has three divisors: 1, 2, and 4.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^4`

## Solution
If `n` has three divisors, then `n` must be a perfect square number. Calculate the square root of `n`, and loop over all integers from 1 to the square root minus 1. For each `i` such that `n` is divisible by `i`, add 2 to the number of divisors. The final divisor is the square root of `n`. Return `true` if the number of divisors equals 3.
