# 1725. Number Of Rectangles That Can Form The Largest Square
## Level
Easy

## Description
You are given an array `rectangles` where `rectangles[i] = [l_i, w_i]` represents the ith rectangle of length `l_i` and width `w_i`.

You can cut the `i-th` rectangle to form a square with a side length of `k` if both `k <= l_i` and `k <= w_i`. For example, if you have a rectangle `[4,6]`, you can cut it to get a square with a side length of at most `4`.

Let `maxLen` be the side length of the **largest** square you can obtain from any of the given rectangles.

Return *the **number** of rectangles that can make a square with a side length of `maxLen`*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** rectangles = [[5,8],[3,9],[5,12],[16,5]]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The largest squares you can get from each rectangle are of lengths [5,3,5,5].

The largest possible square is of length 5, and you can get it out of 3 rectangles.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** rectangles = [[2,3],[3,7],[4,3],[3,7]]

**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= rectangles.length <= 1000`
* `rectangles[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= l_i, w_i <= 10^9`
* `l_i != w_i`

## Solution
Loop over `rectangles`. For each rectangle, obtain the shorter side length as the side length of the square. After all rectangles are checked, the largest square's side length can be determined. Then loop over `rectangles` again and calculate the number of rectangles that can form the largest square.
