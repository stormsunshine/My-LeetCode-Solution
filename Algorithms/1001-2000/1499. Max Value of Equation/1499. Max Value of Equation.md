# 1499. Max Value of Equation
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given an array `points` containing the coordinates of points on a 2D plane, sorted by the x-values, where `points[i] = [x_i, y_i]` such that `x_i < x_j` for all `1 <= i < j <= points.length`. You are also given an integer `k`.

Find the *maximum value of the equation* `y_i + y_j + |x_i - x_j|` where `|x_i - x_j| <= k` and `1 <= i < j <= points.length`. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one pair of points that satisfy the constraint `|x_i - x_j| <= k`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** points = [[1,3],[2,0],[5,10],[6,-10]], k = 1

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The first two points satisfy the condition |x<sub>i</sub> - x<sub>j</sub>| <= 1 and if we calculate the equation we get 3 + 0 + |1 - 2| = 4. Third and fourth points also satisfy the condition and give a value of 10 + -10 + |5 - 6| = 1.

No other pairs satisfy the condition, so we return the max of 4 and 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** points = [[0,0],[3,0],[9,2]], k = 3

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** Only the first two points have an absolute difference of 3 or less in the x-values, and give the value of 0 + 0 + |0 - 3| = 3.

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= points.length <= 10^5`
* `points[i].length == 2`
* `-10^8 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 10^8`
* `0 <= k <= 2 * 10^8`
* `points[i][0] < points[j][0]` for all `1 <= i < j <= points.length`
* `x_i` form a strictly increasing sequence.

## Solution
Use a tree map to store each s-value and the corresponding index in `points`. For `i < j`, there must be `x_i < x_j`, so the equation can be written as `(y_i - x_i) + (x_j + y_j)`. Maintain the values of `y_i - x_i` for all indices `i`. Then loop over `points` and maintain the indices `j` that have the maximum value of `y_j - x_j`, and at the same time update the maximum value of the equation. Finally, return the maximum value of the equation.
