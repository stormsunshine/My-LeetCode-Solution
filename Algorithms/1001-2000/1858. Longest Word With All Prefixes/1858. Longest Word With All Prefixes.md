# 1858. Longest Word With All Prefixes
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of strings `words`, find the **longest** string in `words` such that **every prefix** of it is also in `words`.

* For example, let `words = ["a", "app", "ap"]`. The string `"app"` has prefixes `"ap"` and `"a"`, all of which are in words.

Return *the string described above. If there is more than one string with the same length, return the **lexicographically smallest** one, and if no string exists, return `""`*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** words = ["k","ki","kir","kira", "kiran"]

**Output:** "kiran"

**Explanation:** "kiran" has prefixes "kira", "kir", "ki", and "k", and all of them appear in words.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** words = ["a", "banana", "app", "appl", "ap", "apply", "apple"]

**Output:** "apple"

**Explanation:** Both "apple" and "apply" have all their prefixes in words. However, "apple" is lexicographically smaller, so we return that.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** words = ["abc", "bc", "ab", "qwe"]

**Output:** ""

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= words.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= words[i].length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= sum(words[i].length) <= 10^5`

## Solution
Use a trie to store all the words. Then do depth first search on the trie. Search the nodes from left to right to make sure that the leftmost nodes (with lexicographically smallest letters) are visited first. For the words that all nodes are ends of words, update the longest word. Finally, return the longest word.
