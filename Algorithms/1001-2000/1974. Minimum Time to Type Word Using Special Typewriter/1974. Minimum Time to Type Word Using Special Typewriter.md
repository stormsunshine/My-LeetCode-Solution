# 1974. Minimum Time to Type Word Using Special Typewriter
## Level
Easy

## Description
There is a special typewriter with lowercase English letters `'a'` to `'z'` arranged in a **circle** with a **pointer**. A character can **only** be typed if the pointer is pointing to that character. The pointer is **initially** pointing to the character `'a'`.

Each second, you may perform one of the following operations:

* Move the pointer one character **counterclockwise** or **clockwise**.
* Type the character the pointer is **currently** on.

Given a string `word`, return the **minimum** number of seconds to type out the characters in `word`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** word = "abc"

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**

The characters are printed as follows:
- Type the character 'a' in 1 second since the pointer is initially on 'a'.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'b' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'c' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'c' in 1 second.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** word = "bza"

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:**

The characters are printed as follows:
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'b' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'b' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'z' in 2 seconds.
- Type the character 'z' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'a' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'a' in 1 second.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** word = "zjpc"

**Output:** 34

**Explanation:**

The characters are printed as follows:
- Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'z' in 1 second.
- Type the character 'z' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'j' in 10 seconds.
- Type the character 'j' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer clockwise to 'p' in 6 seconds.
- Type the character 'p' in 1 second.
- Move the pointer counterclockwise to 'c' in 13 seconds.
- Type the character 'c' in 1 second.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= word.length <= 100`
* `word` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solution
The pointer is initially at `'a'`. For each character, first move the pointer to the character, and then type the character. For moving the pointer to the character, calculate the absolute difference between the current character and the previous character, and determine whether to move counterclockwise or clockwise to make the time minimum. For typing the character, it always takes 1 second. Finally, return the minimum total time.
