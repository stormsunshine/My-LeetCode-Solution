## Description
Given a string `date` representing a [Gregorian calendar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregorian_calendar) date formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`, return the day number of the year.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** date = "2019-01-09"

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:** Given date is the 9th day of the year in 2019.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** date = "2019-02-10"

**Output:** 41

**Example 3:**

**Input:** date = "2003-03-01"

**Output:** 60

**Example 4:**

**Input:** date = "2004-03-01"

**Output:** 61

**Constraints:**

* `date.length == 10`
* `date[4] == date[7] == '-'`, and all other `date[i]`'s are digits
* `date` represents a calendar date between Jan 1st, 1900 and Dec 31, 2019.

## Solution
For the given string `date`, first obtain the year, month and day, and next calculate the day number of the year.

If the date is in January or February, then calculate the day number directly. If the date is after February, then whether the current year is a leap year should be checked. If the year is a leap year, then the day number should be added by 1. Then add up all the days before the current month and add the current day to the day number.
