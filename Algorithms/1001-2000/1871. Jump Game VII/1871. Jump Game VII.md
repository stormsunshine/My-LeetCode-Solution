# 1871. Jump Game VII
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** binary string `s` and two integers `minJump` and `maxJump`. In the beginning, you are standing at index `0`, which is equal to `'0'`. You can move from index `i` to index `j` if the following conditions are fulfilled:

* `i + minJump <= j <= min(i + maxJump, s.length - 1)`, and
* `s[j] == '0'`.

Return `true` *if you can reach index `s.length - 1` in `s`, or `false` otherwise*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "011010", minJump = 2, maxJump = 3

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

In the first step, move from index 0 to index 3. 

In the second step, move from index 3 to index 5.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "01101110", minJump = 2, maxJump = 3

**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
* `s[0] == '0'`
* `1 <= minJump <= maxJump < s.length`

## Solution
Use a list to store the indices that have characters '0' in `s`. Then use two pointers `curr` and `next` to mark the indices that can be reached. Initially, index 0 can be reached and `curr = 0`. For each `curr`, find the range of `next` such that `curr + minJump <= next <= curr + maxJump` and `next < s.length()`. Since both `curr` and `next` can only move forward, the two pointers can only loop over all indices once. Finally, return `true` if and only if the index `s.length() - 1` can be reached.
