# 1636. Sort Array by Increasing Frequency
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an array of integers `nums`, sort the array in **increasing** order based on the frequency of the values. If multiple values have the same frequency, sort them in **decreasing** order.

Return the *sorted array*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,1,2,2,2,3]

**Output:** [3,1,1,2,2,2]

**Explanation:** '3' has a frequency of 1, '1' has a frequency of 2, and '2' has a frequency of 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,3,1,3,2]

**Output:** [1,3,3,2,2]

**Explanation:** '2' and '3' both have a frequency of 2, so they are sorted in decreasing order.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [-1,1,-6,4,5,-6,1,4,1]

**Output:** [5,-1,4,4,-6,-6,1,1,1]

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
* `-100 <= nums[i] <= 100`

## Solution
Use a map to store each value's frequency. Then use a list to store the values and sort the list according to frequencies in ascending order and then according to values in descending order. Finally, create a new array to store the values from the list and return.
