# 1721. Swapping Nodes in a Linked List
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given the `head` of a linked list, and an integer `k`.

Return *the head of the linked list after **swapping** the values of the `k-th` node from the beginning and the `k-th` node from the end (the list is **1-indexed**)*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2

**Output:** [1,4,3,2,5]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = [7,9,6,6,7,8,3,0,9,5], k = 5

**Output:** [7,9,6,6,8,7,3,0,9,5]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = [1], k = 1

**Output:** [1]

**Example 4:**

**Input:** head = [1,2], k = 1

**Output:** [2,1]

**Example 5:**

**Input:** head = [1,2,3], k = 2

**Output:** [1,2,3]

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the list is `n`.
* `1 <= k <= n <= 10^5`
* `0 <= Node.val <= 100`

## Solution
Use pointers to obtain the two nodes, which are `node1` and `node2`. The node `node1` is the `k`-th node starting from the beginning, and the node `node2` is the `k`-th node from the end. Then obtain the two nodes' values and swap their values.
