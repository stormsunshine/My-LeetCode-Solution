# 1180. Count Substrings with Only One Distinct Letter
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a string `S`, return the number of substrings that have only **one distinct** letter.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** S = "aaaba"

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:** The substrings with one distinct letter are "aaa", "aa", "a", "b".

"aaa" occurs 1 time.

"aa" occurs 2 times.

"a" occurs 4 times.

"b" occurs 1 time.

So the answer is 1 + 2 + 4 + 1 = 8.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** S = "aaaaaaaaaa"

**Output:** 55

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= S.length <= 1000`
* `S[i]` consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Solution
Loop over the string and find all longest substrings with only one distinct letter. For example, for string "aaaba", the longest substrings with only one distinct letter are "aaa", "b" and "a". For each of the substrings, if the length of the substring is `n`, then the number of substrings in the substring is `n * (n - 1) / 2`. Add up the number of substrings in each such substring to obtain the answer.
