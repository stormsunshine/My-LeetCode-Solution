# 1759. Count Number of Homogenous Substrings
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a string `s`, return *the number of **homogenous** substrings of `s`*. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

A string is **homogenous** if all the characters of the string are the same.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abbcccaa"

**Output:** 13

**Explanation:** The homogenous substrings are listed as below:

"a"   appears 3 times.

"aa"  appears 1 time.

"b"   appears 2 times.

"bb"  appears 1 time.

"c"   appears 3 times.

"cc"  appears 2 times.

"ccc" appears 1 time.

3 + 1 + 2 + 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 13.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "xy"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The homogenous substrings are "x" and "y".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "zzzzz"

**Output:** 15

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s` consists of lowercase letters.

## Solution
First, find all longest substrings such that all characters in the substring are the same. Next, calculate the count of each longest substring. If a longest substring have length `n`, then the number of homogeneous substrings in such a substring is `n * (n + 1) / 2`. Finally, return the total count.
