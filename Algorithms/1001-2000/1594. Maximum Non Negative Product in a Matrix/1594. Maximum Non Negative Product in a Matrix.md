# 1594. Maximum Non Negative Product in a Matrix
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given a `rows x cols` matrix grid. Initially, you are located at the top-left corner `(0, 0)`, and in each step, you can only **move right or down** in the matrix.

Among all possible paths starting from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` and ending in the bottom-right corner `(rows - 1, cols - 1)`, find the path with the **maximum non-negative product**. The product of a path is the product of all integers in the grid cells visited along the path.

Return the *maximum non-negative product **modulo** `10^9 + 7`*. *If the maximum product is **negative** return `-1`*.

**Notice that the modulo is performed after getting the maximum product.**

**Example 1:**
```
Input: grid = [[-1,-2,-3],
               [-2,-3,-3],
               [-3,-3,-2]]
Output: -1
Explanation: It's not possible to get non-negative product in the path from (0, 0) to (2, 2), so return -1.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,-2,1],
               [1,-2,1],
               [3,-4,1]]
Output: 8
Explanation: Maximum non-negative product is 1 * 1 * -2 * -4 * 1 = 8.
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: grid = [[1, 3],
               [0,-4]]
Output: 0
Explanation: Maximum non-negative product is 1 * 0 * -4 = 0.
```
**Example 4:**
```
Input: grid = [[ 1, 4,4,0],
               [-2, 0,0,1],
               [ 1,-1,1,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Maximum non-negative product is 1 * -2 * 1 * -1 * 1 * 1 = 2.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= rows, cols <= 15`
* `-4 <= grid[i][j] <= 4`

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. For the `i`-th row and the `j`-th column, maintain two products, which are the maximum positive product and the minimum negative product (both products have the maximum possible absolute value). If a 0 is met, update the maximum product to 0 if it was -1. Finally, return the maximum non negavie product at the bottom right corner.
