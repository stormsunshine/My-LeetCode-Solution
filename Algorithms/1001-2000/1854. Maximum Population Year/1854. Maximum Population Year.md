# 1854. Maximum Population Year
## Level
Easy

## Description
You are given a 2D integer array `logs` where each `logs[i] = [birth_i, death_i]` indicates the birth and death years of the `i-th` person.

The **population** of some year `x` is the number of people alive during that year. The `i-th` person is counted in year `x`'s population if `x` is in the **inclusive** range `[birth_i, death_i - 1]`. Note that the person is **not** counted in the year that they die.

Return *the **earliest** year with the **maximum population***.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** logs = [[1993,1999],[2000,2010]]

**Output:** 1993

**Explanation:** The maximum population is 1, and 1993 is the earliest year with this population.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** logs = [[1950,1961],[1960,1971],[1970,1981]]

**Output:** 1960

**Explanation:**

The maximum population is 2, and it had happened in years 1960 and 1970.

The earlier year between them is 1960.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= logs.length <= 100`
* `1950 <= birth_i < death_i <= 2050`

## Solution
Use a list to store each person's first and last year. That is, for each `log` in `logs`, add `log[0]` and `-(log[1] - 1)` to the list. Then store the list according to absolute values in ascending order and according to actual values in descending order. Then loop over the list to count the maximum population and store the corresponding year.
