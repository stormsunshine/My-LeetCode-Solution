# 1932. Merge BSTs to Create Single BST
## Level
Hard

## Description
You are given `n` **BST (binary search tree) root nodes** for `n` separate BSTs stored in an array `trees` (**0-indexed**). Each BST in `trees` has **at most 3 nodes**, and no two roots have the same value. In one operation, you can:

* Select two **distinct** indices `i` and `j` such that the value stored at one of the **leaves** of `trees[i]` is equal to the **root value** of `trees[j]`.
* Replace the leaf node in `trees[i]` with `trees[j]`.
* Remove `trees[j]` from `trees`.

Return *the **root** of the resulting BST if it is possible to form a valid BST after performing `n - 1` operations, or `null` if it is impossible to create a valid BST*.

A BST (binary search tree) is a binary tree where each node satisfies the following property:

* Every node in the node's left subtree has a value **strictly less** than the node's value.
* Every node in the node's right subtree has a value **strictly greater** than the node's value.

A leaf is a node that has no children.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** trees = [[2,1],[3,2,5],[5,4]]

**Output:** [3,2,5,1,null,4]

**Explanation:**

In the first operation, pick i=1 and j=0, and merge trees[0] into trees[1].

Delete trees[0], so trees = [[3,2,5,1],[5,4]].

In the second operation, pick i=0 and j=1, and merge trees[1] into trees[0].

Delete trees[1], so trees = [[3,2,5,1,null,4]].

The resulting tree, shown above, is a valid BST, so return its root.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/08/d2.png)

**Input:** trees = [[5,3,8],[3,2,6]]

**Output:** []

**Explanation:**

Pick i=0 and j=1 and merge trees[1] into trees[0].

Delete trees[1], so trees = [[5,3,8,2,6]].

The resulting tree is shown above. This is the only valid operation that can be performed, but the resulting tree is not a valid BST, so return null.

**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/08/d3.png)

**Input:** trees = [[5,4],[3]]

**Output:** []

**Explanation:** It is impossible to perform any operations.

**Example 4:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/08/d4.png)

**Input:** trees = [[2,1,3]]

**Output:** [2,1,3]

**Explanation:** There is only one tree, and it is already a valid BST, so return its root.

**Constraints:**

* `n == trees.length`
* `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^4`
* The number of nodes in each tree is in the range `[1, 3]`.
* No two roots of `trees` have the same value.
* All the trees in the input are **valid BSTs**.
* `1 <= TreeNode.val <= 5 * 10^4`.

## Solution
Obviously, all leaf nodes except root nodes of all trees must have different values. Otherwise, there will be nodes with the same value in the merged tree, which is not a binary search tree. Therefore, loop over all trees and count the number of occurrences of all leaf nodes' values. If there exists a value that occurs more than once, return `null`.

Use a hash map to store each root's value and the corresponding root. Then for each leaf, if there exists a root with the same value as the leaf, replace the leaf with the root.

Finally, there should be only one tree remaining. Otherwise, return `null`. For the remaining tree, check whether it is a binary search tree, and return the tree if it is a binary search tree or `null` otherwise.
