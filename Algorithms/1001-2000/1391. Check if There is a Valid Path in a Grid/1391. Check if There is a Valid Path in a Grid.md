# 1391. Check if There is a Valid Path in a Grid
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a *m x n* `grid`. Each cell of the `grid` represents a street. The street of `grid[i][j]` can be:
* **1** which means a street connecting the left cell and the right cell.
* **2** which means a street connecting the upper cell and the lower cell.
* **3** which means a street connecting the left cell and the lower cell.
* **4** which means a street connecting the right cell and the lower cell.
* **5** which means a street connecting the left cell and the upper cell.
* **6** which means a street connecting the right cell and the upper cell.

You will initially start at the street of the upper-left cell `(0,0)`. A valid path in the grid is a path which starts from the upper left cell `(0,0)` and ends at the bottom-right cell `(m - 1, n - 1)`. **The path should only follow the streets.**

**Notice** that you are **not allowed** to change any street.

Return *true* if there is a valid path in the grid or *false* otherwise.

**Example 1:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/03/05/e1.png)

**Input:** grid = [[2,4,3],[6,5,2]]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** As shown you can start at cell (0, 0) and visit all the cells of the grid to reach (m - 1, n - 1).

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/03/05/e2.png)

**Input:** grid = [[1,2,1],[1,2,1]]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** As shown you the street at cell (0, 0) is not connected with any street of any other cell and you will get stuck at cell (0, 0)

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,1,2]]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** You will get stuck at cell (0, 1) and you cannot reach cell (0, 2).

**Example 4:**

**Input:** grid = [[1,1,1,1,1,1,3]]

**Output:** true

**Example 5:**

**Input:** grid = [[2],[2],[2],[2],[2],[2],[6]]

**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 300`
* `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 6`

## Solution
For each cell, obtain its street and the adjacent cells that can be reached from the current cell. This needs to be done by checking the adjacent cells' streets as well.

Then do breadth first search starting from cell `(0, 0)`. Once the cell `(m - 1, n - 1)` is reached, return `true`. If the cell `(m - 1, n - 1)` is never reached, return `false`.
