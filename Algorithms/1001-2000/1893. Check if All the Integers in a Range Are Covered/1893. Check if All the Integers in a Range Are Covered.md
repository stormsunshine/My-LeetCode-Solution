# 1893. Check if All the Integers in a Range Are Covered
## Level
Easy

## Description
You are given a 2D integer array `ranges` and two integers `left` and `right`. Each `ranges[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represents an **inclusive** interval between `start_i` and `end_i`.

Return `true` *if each integer in the inclusive range `[left, right]` is covered by **at least one** interval in `ranges`*. Return `false` otherwise.

An integer `x` is covered by an interval `ranges[i] = [start_i, end_i]` if `start_i <= x <= end_i`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ranges = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]], left = 2, right = 5

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** Every integer between 2 and 5 is covered:
- 2 is covered by the first range.
- 3 and 4 are covered by the second range.
- 5 is covered by the third range.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** ranges = [[1,10],[10,20]], left = 21, right = 21

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** 21 is not covered by any range.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= ranges.length <= 50`
* `1 <= start_i <= end_i <= 50`
* `1 <= left <= right <= 50`

## Solution
Since the data range is limited, for each `range` in `ranges`, consider the intersection of `range` and `[left, right]`, and add all the numbers in the intersection into a hash set. Finally, check whether the hash set's size is `right - left + 1`.
