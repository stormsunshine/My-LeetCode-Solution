# 1334. Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance
## Level
Medium

## Description
There are `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n-1`. Given the array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i, weight_i]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities `from_i` and `to_i`, and given the integer `distanceThreshold`.

Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable through some path and whose distance is **at most** `distanceThreshold`. If there are multiple such cities, return the city with the greatest number.

Notice that the distance of a path connecting cities ***i*** and ***j*** is equal to the sum of the edges' weights along that path.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,1,3],[1,2,1],[1,3,4],[2,3,1]], distanceThreshold = 4

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The figure above describes the graph.

The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4 for each city are:

City 0 -> [City 1, City 2]

City 1 -> [City 0, City 2, City 3]

City 2 -> [City 0, City 1, City 3]

City 3 -> [City 1, City 2]

Cities 0 and 3 have 2 neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 4, but we have to return city 3 since it has the greatest number.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5, edges = [[0,1,2],[0,4,8],[1,2,3],[1,4,2],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]], distanceThreshold = 2

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:* The figure above describes the graph.

The neighboring cities at a distanceThreshold = 2 for each city are:

City 0 -> [City 1]

City 1 -> [City 0, City 4]

City 2 -> [City 3, City 4]

City 3 -> [City 2, City 4]

City 4 -> [City 1, City 2, City 3]

The city 0 has 1 neighboring city at a distanceThreshold = 2.

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 100`
* `1 <= edges.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2`
* `1edges[i].length == 3`
* `0 <= from_i < to_i < n`
* `1 <= weight_i, distanceThreshold <= 10^4`
All pairs `(from_i, to_i)` are distinct.

## Solution
This problem is about finding shortest paths in a graph. Several solutions exist for finding shortest paths. This solution uses Dijkstra's algorithm.

In Dijkstra's algorithm, maintain a priority queue that stores the cities with their corresponding distances, where the city with the minimum distance is polled first. For each city, use the algorithm to find the shortest distances from the city to the other cities.

After the distances are obtained, for each city, count the number of cities that are reachable with a distance less than or equal to `distanceThreshold`. Return the city with the greatest number that has the smallest number of cities reachable.
