# 1876. Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters
## Level
Easy

## Description
A string is **good** if there are no repeated characters.

Given a string `s`, return *the number of **good substrings** of length **three** in `s`*.

Note that if there are multiple occurrences of the same substring, every occurrence should be counted.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "xyzzaz"

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** There are 4 substrings of size 3: "xyz", "yzz", "zza", and "zaz". 

The only good substring of length 3 is "xyz".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "aababcabc"

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** There are 7 substrings of size 3: "aab", "aba", "bab", "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".

The good substrings are "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 100`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solution
Loop over all substrings with length three of `s`. For each such substring, check whether the three characters are all distinct. Count the substrings with length three and all characters distinct, and return the count.
