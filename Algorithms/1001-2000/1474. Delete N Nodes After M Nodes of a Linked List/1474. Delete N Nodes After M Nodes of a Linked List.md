# 1474. Delete N Nodes After M Nodes of a Linked List
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given the `head` of a linked list and two integers `m` and `n`. Traverse the linked list and remove some nodes in the following way:

* Start with the head as the current node.
* Keep the first `m` nodes starting with the current node.
* Remove the next `n` nodes
* Keep repeating steps 2 and 3 until you reach the end of the list.

Return the head of the modified list after removing the mentioned nodes.

**Follow up question:** How can you solve this problem by modifying the list in-place?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13], m = 2, n = 3

**Output:** [1,2,6,7,11,12]

**Explanation:** Keep the first (m = 2) nodes starting from the head of the linked List  (1 ->2) show in black nodes.

Delete the next (n = 3) nodes (3 -> 4 -> 5) show in read nodes.

Continue with the same procedure until reaching the tail of the Linked List.
Head of linked list after removing nodes is returned.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], m = 1, n = 3

**Output:** [1,5,9]

**Explanation:** Head of linked list after removing nodes is returned.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** head = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], m = 3, n = 1

**Output:** [1,2,3,5,6,7,9,10,11]

**Example 4:**

**Input:** head = [9,3,7,7,9,10,8,2], m = 1, n = 2

**Output:** [9,7,8]

**Constraints:**

* The given linked list will contain between `1` and `10^4` nodes.
* The value of each node in the linked list will be in the range `[1, 10^6]`.
* `1 <= m,n <= 1000`

## Solution
Create a dummy node that is before the head. Starting from the dummy node, each time move forward `m` steps, and then set the current node's next node `n` steps ahead. Repeat the process until the end of the list is reached. Finally, return the head of the list.
