# 1469. Find All the Lonely Nodes
## Level
Easy

## Description
In a binary tree, a **lonely** node is a node that is the only child of its parent node. The root of the tree is not lonely because it does not have a parent node.

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return an array containing the values of all lonely nodes in the tree. Return the list **in any order**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,4]

**Output:** [4]

**Explanation:** Light blue node is the only lonely node.

Node 1 is the root and is not lonely.

Nodes 2 and 3 have the same parent and are not lonely.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [7,1,4,6,null,5,3,null,null,null,null,null,2]

**Output:** [6,2]

**Explanation:** Light blue nodes are lonely nodes.
Please remember that order doesn't matter, [2,6] is also an acceptable answer.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [11,99,88,77,null,null,66,55,null,null,44,33,null,null,22]

**Output:** [77,55,33,66,44,22]

**Explanation:** Nodes 99 and 88 share the same parent. Node 11 is the root.
All other nodes are lonely.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** root = [197]

**Output:** []

**Example 5:**

**Input:** root = [31,null,78,null,28]

**Output:** [78,28]

Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
* Each node's value is between `[1, 10^6]`.

## Solution
Create a list to store the values of all lonely nodes. If `root` is `null`, return the list directly.

Do breadth first search. For each node, check its two children. For each non-empty child, offer the child to the queue for the next step's search. If exactly one child is non-empty, then add the non-empty child's value into the list.

Finally, return the list.
