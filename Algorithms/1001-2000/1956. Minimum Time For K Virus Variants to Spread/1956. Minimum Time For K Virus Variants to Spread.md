# 1956. Minimum Time For K Virus Variants to Spread
## Level
Hard

## Description
There are `n` **unique** virus variants in an infinite 2D grid. You are given a 2D array `points`, where `points[i] = [x_i, y_i]` represents a virus originating at `(x_i, y_i)` on day `0`. Note that it is possible for **multiple** virus variants to originate at the **same** point.

Every day, each cell infected with a virus variant will spread the virus to **all** neighboring points in the **four** cardinal directions (i.e. up, down, left, and right). If a cell has multiple variants, all the variants will spread without interfering with each other.

Given an integer `k`, return *the **minimum integer** number of days for **any** point to contain at least `k` of the unique virus variants*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** points = [[1,1],[6,1]], k = 2

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** On day 3, points (3,1) and (4,1) will contain both virus variants.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** points = [[3,3],[1,2],[9,2]], k = 2

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** On day 2, points (1,3), (2,3), (2,2), and (3,2) will contain the first two viruses.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** points = [[3,3],[1,2],[9,2]], k = 3

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** On day 4, the point (5,2) will contain all 3 viruses.

**Constraints:**

* `n == points.length`
* `2 <= n <= 50`
* `points[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= x_i, y_i <= 10^9`
* `2 <= k <= n`

## Solution
Use binary search. For a specific number of days, calculate whether there exists a point that contains at least `k` virus variants.
