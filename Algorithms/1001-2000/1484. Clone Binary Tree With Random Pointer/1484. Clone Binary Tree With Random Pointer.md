# 1484. Clone Binary Tree With Random Pointer
## Level
Medium

## Description
A binary tree is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the tree or null.

Return a *[deep copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy)* of the tree.

The tree is represented in the same input/output way as normal binary trees where each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:

* `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
* `random_index`: the index of the node (in the input) where the random pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

You will be given the tree in class `Node` and you should return the cloned tree in class `NodeCopy`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [[1,null],null,[4,3],[7,0]]

**Output:** [[1,null],null,[4,3],[7,0]]

**Explanation:** The original binary tree is [1,null,4,7].

The random pointer of node one is null, so it is represented as [1, null].

The random pointer of node 4 is node 7, so it is represented as [4, 3] where 3 is the index of node 7 in the tree array.

The random pointer of node 7 is node 1, so it is represented as [7, 0] where 0 is the index of node 1 in the tree array

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [[1,4],null,[1,0],null,[1,5],[1,5]]

**Output:** [[1,4],null,[1,0],null,[1,5],[1,5]]

**Explanation:** The random pointer of a node can be the node itself.

**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/06/13/e2.png)

**Input:** root = [[1,6],[2,5],[3,4],[4,3],[5,2],[6,1],[7,0]]

**Output:** [[1,6],[2,5],[3,4],[4,3],[5,2],[6,1],[7,0]]

**Example 4:**

**Input:** root = []

**Output:** []

**Example 5:**

**Input:** root = [[1,null],null,[2,null],null,[1,null]]

**Output:** [[1,null],null,[2,null],null,[1,null]]

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the `tree` is in the range `[0, 1000]`.
* Each node's value is between `[1, 10^6]`.

## Solution
Use a map to store each original node and the corresponding copied node. First, create the copied root and store the original root and the copied root into the map. Then create the copied tree recursively.
