# 1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores
## Level
Easy

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` represents the score of the `i-th` student. You are also given an integer `k`.

Pick the scores of any `k` students from the array so that the **difference** between the **highest** and the **lowest** of the `k` scores is **minimized**.

Return *the **minimum** possible difference*.

**Example 1:**

**Input**: nums = [90], k = 1

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** There is one way to pick score(s) of one student:
- [90]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 90 - 90 = 0.
The minimum possible difference is 0.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [9,4,1,7], k = 2

**Output8*: 2

**Explanation:** There are six ways to pick score(s) of two students:
- [**9**,**4**,1,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 4 = 5.
- [**9**,4,**1**,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 1 = 8.
- [**9**,4,1,**7**]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 9 - 7 = 2.
- [9,**4**,**1**,7]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 4 - 1 = 3.
- [9,**4**,1,**7**]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 4 = 3.
- [9,4,**1**,**7**]. The difference between the highest and lowest score is 7 - 1 = 6.

The minimum possible difference is 2.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Solution
Sort the array `nums` and for each pair of elements with indices differ by `k - 1`, calculate the differences of the pair of elements. Rethrn the minimum difference.
