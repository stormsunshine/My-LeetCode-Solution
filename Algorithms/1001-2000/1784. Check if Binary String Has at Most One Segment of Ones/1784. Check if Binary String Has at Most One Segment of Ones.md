# 1784. Check if Binary String Has at Most One Segment of Ones
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a binary string `s` **without leading zeros**, return `true` *if `s` contains **at most one contiguous segment of ones***. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "1001"

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** The ones do not form a contiguous segment.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "110"

**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 100`
* `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.
* `s[0]` is `'1'`.

## Solution
Loop over `s` from left to right. For each character, if the character is `'1'` and its previous character is `'0'`, then the current character is the first character of a segment of ones. Return `true` only if the number of segments of ones is at most 1.
