# 1679. Max Number of K-Sum Pairs
## Level
Easy

## Description
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals `k` and remove them from the array.

Return *the maximum number of operations you can perform on the array*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** Starting with nums = [1,2,3,4]:
- Remove numbers 1 and 4, then nums = [2,3]
- Remove numbers 2 and 3, then nums = []

There are no more pairs that sum up to 5, hence a total of 2 operations.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** Starting with nums = [3,1,3,4,3]:
- Remove the first two 3's, then nums = [1,4,3]

There are no more pairs that sum up to 6, hence a total of 1 operation.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
* `1 <= k <= 10^9`

## Solution
Sort `nums` and use two pointers. Initialize `low = 0` and `high = nums.length - 1`. Each time calculate `nums[low] + nums[high]`. If the sum equals `k`, then a k-sum pair is found, and do both `low++` and `high--`. Otherwise, if the sum is less than `k`, then do `low++`, and if the sum is greater than `k`, then do `high--`. Repeat the process until `low >= high`. Finally, return the number of k-sum pairs.
