# 1935. Maximum Number of Words You Can Type
## Level
Easy

## Description
There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.

Given a string `text` of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string `brokenLetters` of all **distinct** letter keys that are broken, return* the **number of words** in `text` you can fully type using this keyboard*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** text = "hello world", brokenLetters = "ad"

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** We cannot type "world" because the 'd' key is broken.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "lt"

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** We cannot type "leet" because the 'l' and 't' keys are broken.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** text = "leet code", brokenLetters = "e"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** We cannot type either word because the 'e' key is broken.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= text.length <= 10^4`
* `0 <= brokenLetters.length <= 26`
* `text` consists of words separated by a single space without any leading or trailing spaces.
* Each word only consists of lowercase English letters.
* `brokenLetters` consists of **distinct** lowercase English letters.

## Solution
Use a hash set to store the letters in `brokenLetters`. Split `text` into an array of words. For each word, check whether there exists at least one letter in the word that is in the set. If so, the word cannot be typed. Finally, return the number of words that can be typed.
