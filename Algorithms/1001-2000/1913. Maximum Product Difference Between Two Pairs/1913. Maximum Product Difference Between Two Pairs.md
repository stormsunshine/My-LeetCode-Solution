# 1913. Maximum Product Difference Between Two Pairs
## Level
Easy

## Description
The **product difference** between two pairs `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` is defined as `(a * b) - (c * d)`.

* For example, the product difference between `(5, 6)` and `(2, 7)` is `(5 * 6) - (2 * 7) = 16`.

Given an integer array `nums`, choose four **distinct** indices `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` such that the **product difference** between pairs `(nums[w], nums[x]) and (nums[y], nums[z])` is **maximized**.

Return *the **maximum** such product difference*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [5,6,2,7,4]

**Output:** 34

**Explanation:** We can choose indices 1 and 3 for the first pair (6, 7) and indices 2 and 4 for the second pair (2, 4).

The product difference is (6 * 7) - (2 * 4) = 34.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [4,2,5,9,7,4,8]

**Output:** 64

**Explanation:** We can choose indices 3 and 6 for the first pair (9, 8) and indices 1 and 5 for the second pair (2, 4).

The product difference is (9 * 8) - (2 * 4) = 64.

**Constraints:**

* `4 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution
Since all elements in `nums` are positive, to maximize the product difference, the two pairs should be the two maximum elements and the two minimum elements, respectively. Therefore, sort the array, get the two maximum elements and the two minimum elements, and return the product difference between the two pairs.
