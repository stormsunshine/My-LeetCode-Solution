# 1791. Find Center of Star Graph
## Level
Medium

## Description
There is an undirected **star** graph consisting of `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. A star graph is a graph where there is one **center** node and **exactly** `n - 1` edges that connect the center node with every other node.

You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates that there is an edge between the nodes `u_i` and `v_i`. Return the center of the given star graph.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** As shown in the figure above, node 2 is connected to every other node, so 2 is the center.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** edges = [[1,2],[5,1],[1,3],[1,4]]

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

* `3 <= n <= 10^5`
* `edges.length == n - 1`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= u_i, v_i <= n`
* `u_i != v_i`
* The given `edges` represent a valid star graph.

## Solution
The given star graph is actually a tree, with `n` nodes and `n - 1` edges. The center of the star graph has `n - 1` edges connected to it, and each of the remaining nodes has 1 edge connected to it. Simply calculate the number of edges connected to each node, and return the node that has more than 1 edge connected to it.
