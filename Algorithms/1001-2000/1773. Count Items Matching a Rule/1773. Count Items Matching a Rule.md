# 1773. Count Items Matching a Rule
## Level
Easy

## Description
You are given an array `items`, where each `items[i] = [type_i, color_i, name_i]` describes the type, color, and name of the `i-th` item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, `ruleKey` and `ruleValue`.

The `i-th` item is said to match the rule if **one** of the following is true:

* `ruleKey == "type"` and `ruleValue == type*i`.
* `ruleKey == "color"` and `ruleValue == color*i`.
* `ruleKey == "name"` and `ruleValue == name_i`.

Return *the number of items that match the given rule*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "color", ruleValue = "silver"

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** There is only one item matching the given rule, which is ["computer","silver","lenovo"].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","phone"],["phone","gold","iphone"]], ruleKey = "type", ruleValue = "phone"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** There are only two items matching the given rule, which are ["phone","blue","pixel"] and ["phone","gold","iphone"]. Note that the item ["computer","silver","phone"] does not match.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= items.length <= 10^4`
* `1 <= type_i.length, color_i.length, name_i.length, ruleValue.length <= 10`
* `ruleKey` is equal to either `"type"`, `"color"`, or `"name"`.
* All strings consist only of lowercase letters.

## Solution
Loop over all items. For each item, check whether it matches `ruleKey` and `ruleValue`. Count the items that match the rule and return the count.
