# 1937. Maximum Number of Points with Cost
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `points` (**0-indexed**). Starting with 0 points, you want to **maximize** the number of points you can get from the matrix.

To gain points, you must pick one cell in **each row**. Picking the cell at coordinates `(r, c)` will add `points[r][c]` to your score.

However, you will lose points if you pick a cell too far from the cell that you picked in the previous row. For every two adjacent rows `r` and `r + 1` (where `0 <= r < m - 1`), picking cells at coordinates `(r, c1)` and `(r + 1, c2)` will **subtract** `abs(c1 - c2)` from your score.

Return *the **maximum** number of points you can achieve*.

`abs(x)` is defined as:

* `x` for `x >= 0`.
* `-x` for `x < 0`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** points = [[1,2,3],[1,5,1],[3,1,1]]

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:**

The blue cells denote the optimal cells to pick, which have coordinates (0, 2), (1, 1), and (2, 0).

You add 3 + 5 + 3 = 11 to your score.

However, you must subtract abs(2 - 1) + abs(1 - 0) = 2 from your score.
Your final score is 11 - 2 = 9.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** points = [[1,5],[2,3],[4,2]]

**Output:** 11

**Explanation:**

The blue cells denote the optimal cells to pick, which have coordinates (0, 1), (1, 1), and (2, 0).

You add 5 + 3 + 4 = 12 to your score.

However, you must subtract abs(1 - 1) + abs(1 - 0) = 1 from your score.

Your final score is 12 - 1 = 11.

**Constraints:**

* `m == points.length`
* `n == points[r].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 10^5`
* `1 <= m * n <= 10^5`
* `0 <= points[r][c] <= 10^5`

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `dp` of `m` rows and `n` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of points at position `(i, j)`. When `i = 0`, `dp[0][j] = points[0][j]` for all `0 <= j < n`.

For `1 <= i < m`, to calculate `dp[i][j]`, the maximum values from the previous row need to be calculated. Let `prevRowLeft[j] = dp[i - 1][j] - (n - 1 - j)` and `prevRowRight[j] = dp[i - 1][j] - j`. Let `leftMax[j]` be the maximum from `prevRowLeft[0]` to `prevRowLeft[j]` and `rightMax[j]` be the maximum from `prevRowRight[j]` to `prevRowRight[n - 1]`. Then for `dp[i][j]`, the value is calculated as `Math.max(leftMax[j] + n - 1 - j, rightMax[j] + j) + points[i][j]`.

Finally, return the maximum value in `dp[m - 1]`.
