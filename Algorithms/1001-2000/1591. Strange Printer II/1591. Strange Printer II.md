# 1591. Strange Printer II
## Level
Hard

## Description
There is a strange printer with the following two special requirements:

* On each turn, the printer will print a solid rectangular pattern of a single color on the grid. This will cover up the existing colors in the rectangle.
* Once the printer has used a color for the above operation, **the same color cannot be used again**.

You are given a `m x n` matrix `targetGrid`, where `targetGrid[row][col]` is the color in the position `(row, col)` of the grid.

Return `true` *if it is possible to print the matrix `targetGrid`, otherwise, return* `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** targetGrid = [[1,1,1,1],[1,2,2,1],[1,2,2,1],[1,1,1,1]]

**Output:** true

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/15/sample_2_1929.png)

**Input:** targetGrid = [[1,1,1,1],[1,1,3,3],[1,1,3,4],[5,5,1,4]]

**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

**Input:** targetGrid = [[1,2,1],[2,1,2],[1,2,1]]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** It is impossible to form targetGrid because it is not allowed to print the same color in different turns.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** targetGrid = [[1,1,1],[3,1,3]]

**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

* `m == targetGrid.length`
* `n == targetGrid[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 60`
* `1 <= targetGrid[row][col] <= 60`

## Solution
For each color, find the range of the color in `targetGrid`, which includes the minimum row, the maximum row, the minimum column, and the maximum column. Then loop over `targetGrid`. For each cell in `targetGrid`, obtain the color and find all the colors that must be printed before the current color. This forms a directed graph among all the colors. Then do topological sort to check whether there exists a cycle in the directed graph. If no cycle exists, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.
