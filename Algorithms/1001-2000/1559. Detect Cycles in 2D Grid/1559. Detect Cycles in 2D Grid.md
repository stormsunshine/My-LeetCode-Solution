# 1559. Detect Cycles in 2D Grid
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a 2D array of characters `grid` of size `m x n`, you need to find if there exists any cycle consisting of the **same value** in `grid`.

A cycle is a path of **length 4 or more** in the grid that starts and ends at the same cell. From a given cell, you can move to one of the cells adjacent to it - in one of the four directions (up, down, left, or right), if it has the **same value** of the current cell.

Also, you cannot move to the cell that you visited in your last move. For example, the cycle `(1, 1) -> (1, 2) -> (1, 1)` is invalid because from `(1, 2)` we visited `(1, 1)` which was the last visited cell.

Return `true` if any cycle of the same value exists in `grid`, otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** grid = [["a","a","a","a"],["a","b","b","a"],["a","b","b","a"],["a","a","a","a"]]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** There are two valid cycles shown in different colors in the image below:

**Example 2:**

**Input:** grid = [["c","c","c","a"],["c","d","c","c"],["c","c","e","c"],["f","c","c","c"]]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** There is only one valid cycle highlighted in the image below:

**Example 3:**

**Input:** grid = [["a","b","b"],["b","z","b"],["b","b","a"]]

**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

* `m == grid.length`
* `n == grid[i].length`
* `1 <= m <= 500`
* `1 <= n <= 500`
* `grid` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Solution
Use depth first search. For each cell, store its predecessor in depth first search.

Starting from each unvisited cell. For each adjacent cell, if it is unvisited and  has the same character as the starting cell, then update the adjacent cell's predecessor as the starting cell, and continue depth first search for the adjacent cell. If it is already visited and the starting cell's predecessor is not the adjacent cell, then a loop is found, so return `true`. If no loop is found, then return `false`.
