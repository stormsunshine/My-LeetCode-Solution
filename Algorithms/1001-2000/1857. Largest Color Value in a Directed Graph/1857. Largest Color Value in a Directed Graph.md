# 1857. Largest Color Value in a Directed Graph
## Level
Hard

## Description
There is a **directed graph** of `n` colored nodes and `m` edges. The nodes are numbered from `0` to `n - 1`.

You are given a string `colors` where `colors[i]` is a lowercase English letter representing the **color** of the `i-th` node in this graph (**0-indexed**). You are also given a 2D array `edges` where `edges[j] = [a_j, b_j]` indicates that there is a **directed edge** from node `a_j` to node `b_j`.

A valid **path** in the graph is a sequence of nodes `x_1 -> x_2 -> x_3 -> ... -> x_k` such that there is a directed edge from `x_i` to `x_(i+1)` for every `1 <= i < k`. The **color value** of the path is the number of nodes that are colored the **most frequently** occurring color along that path.

Return *the **largest color value** of any valid path in the given graph, or `-1` if the graph contains a cycle*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** colors = "abaca", edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[3,4]]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The path 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 contains 3 nodes that are colored "a" (red in the above image).

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/21/leet2.png)

**Input:** colors = "a", edges = [[0,0]]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:** There is a cycle from 0 to 0.

**Constraints:**

* `n == colors.length`
* `m == edges.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `0 <= m <= 10^5`
* `colors` consists of lowercase English letters.
* `0 <= a_j, b_j < n`

## Solution
Use topological sort and dynamic programming. Starting from all nodes with indegrees equal to 0, use topological sort to determine whether the graph contains a cycle. If the grapy contains a cycle, return -1. Otherwise, for each node, store the maximum frequency of each color. Maintain the maximum frequency during the process. Finally, return the maximum frequency.
