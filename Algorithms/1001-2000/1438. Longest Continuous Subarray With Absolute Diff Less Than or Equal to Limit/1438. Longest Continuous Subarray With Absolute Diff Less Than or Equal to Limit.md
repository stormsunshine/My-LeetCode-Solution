# 1438. Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `limit`, return the size of the longest continuous subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements is less than or equal to `limit`.

In case there is no subarray satisfying the given condition return 0.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [8,2,4,7], limit = 4
Output: 2 
Explanation: All subarrays are: 
[8] with maximum absolute diff |8-8| = 0 <= 4.
[8,2] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4. 
[8,2,4] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[8,2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |8-2| = 6 > 4.
[2] with maximum absolute diff |2-2| = 0 <= 4.
[2,4] with maximum absolute diff |2-4| = 2 <= 4.
[2,4,7] with maximum absolute diff |2-7| = 5 > 4.
[4] with maximum absolute diff |4-4| = 0 <= 4.
[4,7] with maximum absolute diff |4-7| = 3 <= 4.
[7] with maximum absolute diff |7-7| = 0 <= 4. 
Therefore, the size of the longest subarray is 2.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [10,1,2,4,7,2], limit = 5
Output: 4 
Explanation: The subarray [2,4,7,2] is the longest since the maximum absolute diff is |2-7| = 5 <= 5.
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [4,2,2,2,4,4,2,2], limit = 0
Output: 3
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
* `0 <= limit <= 10^9`

## Solution
Use the concept of sliding window and use a tree map to store each element's number of occurrences, where the elements (the keys in the tree map) are sorted in ascending order. Maintain the maximum length and initialize the start index of the sliding window `start` to 0.

Loop over `nums`. Each time obtain the current number and update the count in the tree map. Obtain the maximum element and the minimum element from the tree map and calculate their difference. If the difference is greater than `limit`, then move `start` to the right and update the number of occurrences in the tree map accordingly until the difference between the maximum element and the minimum element is less than or equal to `limit`. When the difference between the maximum element and the minimum element is less than or equal to `limit`, update the maximum length using the current index and the start index `start`. Finally, return the maximum length.
