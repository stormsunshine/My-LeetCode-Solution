# 1943. Describe the Painting
## Level

## Description
There is a long and thin painting that can be represented by a number line. The painting was painted with multiple overlapping segments where each segment was painted with a **unique** color. You are given a 2D integer array `segments`, where `segments[i] = [start_i, end_i, color_i]` represents the **half-closed segment** `[start_i, end_i)` with `color_i` as the color.

The colors in the overlapping segments of the painting were **mixed** when it was painted. When two or more colors mix, they form a new color that can be represented as a **set** of mixed colors.

- For example, if colors `2`, `4`, and `6` are mixed, then the resulting mixed color is `{2,4,6}`.

For the sake of simplicity, you should only output the **sum** of the elements in the set rather than the full set.

You want to **describe** the painting with the **minimum** number of non-overlapping **half-closed segments** of these mixed colors. These segments can be represented by the 2D array `painting` where `painting[j] = [left_j, right_j, mix_j]` describes a **half-closed segment** `[left_j, right_j)` with the mixed color **sum** of `mix_j`.

- For example, the painting created with `segments = [[1,4,5],[1,7,7]]` can be described by `painting = [[1,4,12],[4,7,7]]` because:
   - `[1,4)` is colored `{5,7}` (with a sum of `12`) from both the first and second segments.
   - `[4,7)` is colored `{7}` from only the second segment.

Return *the 2D array `painting` describing the finished painting (excluding any parts that are **not** painted). You may return the segments in **any order***.

A **half-closed segment** `[a, b)` is the section of the number line between points `a` and `b` **including** point `a` and **not including** point `b`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** segments = [[1,4,5],[4,7,7],[1,7,9]]

**Output:** [[1,4,14],[4,7,16]]

**Explanation:** The painting can be described as follows:
- [1,4) is colored {5,9} (with a sum of 14) from the first and third segments.
- [4,7) is colored {7,9} (with a sum of 16) from the second and third segments.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/18/2.png)

**Input:** segments = [[1,7,9],[6,8,15],[8,10,7]]

**Output:** [[1,6,9],[6,7,24],[7,8,15],[8,10,7]]

**Explanation:** The painting can be described as follows:
- [1,6) is colored 9 from the first segment.
- [6,7) is colored {9,15} (with a sum of 24) from the first and second segments.
- [7,8) is colored 15 from the second segment.
- [8,10) is colored 7 from the third segment.

**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/04/c1.png)

**Input:** segments = [[1,4,5],[1,4,7],[4,7,1],[4,7,11]]

**Output:** [[1,4,12],[4,7,12]]

**Explanation:** The painting can be described as follows:
- [1,4) is colored {5,7} (with a sum of 12) from the first and second segments.
- [4,7) is colored {1,11} (with a sum of 12) from the third and fourth segments.

Note that returning a single segment [1,7) is incorrect because the mixed color sets are different.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= segments.length <= 2 * 10^4`
* `segments[i].length == 3`
* `1 <= start_i < end_i <= 10^5`
* `1 <= colori <= 10^9`
* Each `color_i` is distinct.

## Solution
Use the idea of prefix sum. For each segment, if the color is `color`, add `color` to the start of the segment and add `-color` to the end of the segment. After looping over all segments, the final segments are determined. Calculate each segment's sum of colors and return the segments.
