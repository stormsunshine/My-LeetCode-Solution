# 1998. GCD Sort of an Array
## Level
Hard

## Description
You are given an integer array `nums`, and you can perform the following operation **any** number of times on `nums`:

* Swap the positions of two elements `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` if `gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1` where `gcd(nums[i], nums[j])` is the **greatest common divisor** of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`.

Return *`true` if it is possible to sort `nums` in **non-decreasing** order using the above swap method, or `false` otherwise*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [7,21,3]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** We can sort [7,21,3] by performing the following operations:
- Swap 7 and 21 because gcd(7,21) = 7. nums = [21,7,3]
- Swap 21 and 3 because gcd(21,3) = 3. nums = [3,7,21]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [5,2,6,2]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** It is impossible to sort the array because 5 cannot be swapped with any other element.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [10,5,9,3,15]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** We can sort [10,5,9,3,15] by performing the following operations:
- Swap 10 and 15 because gcd(10,15) = 5. nums = [15,5,9,3,10]
- Swap 15 and 3 because gcd(15,3) = 3. nums = [3,5,9,15,10]
- Swap 10 and 15 because gcd(10,15) = 5. nums = [3,5,9,10,15]

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
* `2 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Solution
Use union find to partition the numbers from 1 to 100000 into groups such that for any group, if `a` is in the group, then there always exists a number `b` such that `gcd(a, b) > 1`. Then generate a sorted version of `nums`, which is `sorted`. If for any `0 <= i < nums.length`, `nums[i]` and `sorted[i]` belong to the same group, then return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.
