# 1926. Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given an `m x n` matrix maze (**0-indexed**) with empty cells (represented as `'.'`) and walls (represented as `'+'`). You are also given the `entrance` of the maze, where `entrance = [entrance_row, entrance_col]` denotes the row and column of the cell you are initially standing at.

In one step, you can move one cell **up**, **down**, **left**, or **right**. You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the **nearest exit** from the `entrance`. An **exit** is defined as an **empty cell** that is at the **border** of the `maze`. The `entrance` **does not count** as an exit.

Return *the **number of steps** in the shortest path from the `entrance` to the nearest exit, or `-1` if no such path exists*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** maze = [["+","+",".","+"],[".",".",".","+"],["+","+","+","."]], entrance = [1,2]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** There are 3 exits in this maze at [1,0], [0,2], and [2,3].

Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,2].
- You can reach [1,0] by moving 2 steps left.
- You can reach [0,2] by moving 1 step up.

It is impossible to reach [2,3] from the entrance.

Thus, the nearest exit is [0,2], which is 1 step away.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/nearesr2-grid.jpg)

**Input:** maze = [["+","+","+"],[".",".","."],["+","+","+"]], entrance = [1,0]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** There is 1 exit in this maze at [1,2].

[1,0] does not count as an exit since it is the entrance cell.

Initially, you are at the entrance cell [1,0].
- You can reach [1,2] by moving 2 steps right.

Thus, the nearest exit is [1,2], which is 2 steps away.

**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/nearest3-grid.jpg)

**Input:** maze = [[".","+"]], entrance = [0,0]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:** There are no exits in this maze.

**Constraints:**

* `maze.length == m`
* `maze[i].length == n`
* `1 <= m, n <= 100`
* `maze[i][j]` is either `'.'` or `'+'`.
* `entrance.length == 2`
* `0 <= entrance_row < m`
* `0 <= entrance_col < n`
* `entrance` will always be an empty cell.

## Solution
Do breadth-first search in `maze` starting from `entrance`. The cell `entrance` is visited first and does not count as an exit. Once the first empty cell that is on the border is visited, return the number of steps.
