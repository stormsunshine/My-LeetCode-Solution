# 1794. Count Pairs of Equal Substrings With Minimum Difference
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given two strings `firstString` and `secondString` that are **0-indexed** and consist only of lowercase English letters. Count the number of index quadruples `(i,j,a,b)` that satisfy the following conditions:

* `0 <= i <= j < firstString.length`
* `0 <= a <= b < secondString.length`
* The substring of `firstString` that starts at the `i-th` character and ends at the `j-th` character (inclusive) is **equal** to the substring of `secondString` that starts at the `a-th` character and ends at the `b-th` character (inclusive).
* `j - a` is the **minimum** possible value among all quadruples that satisfy the previous conditions.

Return *the **number** of such quadruples*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** firstString = "abcd", secondString = "bccda"

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** The quadruple (0,0,4,4) is the only one that satisfies all the conditions and minimizes j - a.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** firstString = "ab", secondString = "cd"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** There are no quadruples satisfying all the conditions.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= firstString.length, secondString.length <= 2 * 10^5`
* Both strings consist only of lowercase English letters.

## Solution
First, find the minimum possible value `j - a`. If the equal substrings have lengths greater than 1, then after selecting shorter equal substrings, `j - a` can be reduced, so to obtain the minimum possible value `j - a`, always consider substrings with length 1. Find each character's first occurrence in `firstString` and each character's last occurrence in `lastString`, loop over all characters and find the minimum possible value `j - a`.

Next, count the number of pairs `(j, a)` that have the minimum possible value `j - a`. The number of pairs `(j, a)` is equal to the number of quadruples `(i, j, a, b)` since `i == j` and `a == b`.

Finally, return the count.
