# 1489. Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum Spanning Tree
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a weighted undirected connected graph with `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i, weight_i]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between nodes `from_i` and `to_i`. A minimum spanning tree (MST) is a subset of the edges of the graph that connects all vertices without cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight.

Find all the critical and pseudo-critical edges in the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the given graph. An MST edge whose deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to increase is called a critical edge. A pseudo-critical edge, on the other hand, is that which can appear in some MSTs but not all.

Note that you can return the indices of the edges in any order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[0,3,2],[0,4,3],[3,4,3],[1,4,6]]

**Output:** [[0,1],[2,3,4,5]]

**Explanation:** The figure above describes the graph.

The following figure shows all the possible MSTs:

Notice that the two edges 0 and 1 appear in all MSTs, therefore they are critical edges, so we return them in the first list of the output.

The edges 2, 3, 4, and 5 are only part of some MSTs, therefore they are considered pseudo-critical edges. We add them to the second list of the output.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,1],[0,3,1]]

**Output:** [[],[0,1,2,3]]

**Explanation:** We can observe that since all 4 edges have equal weight, choosing any 3 edges from the given 4 will yield an MST. Therefore all 4 edges are pseudo-critical.

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 100`
* `1 <= edges.length <= min(200, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
* `edges[i].length == 3`
* `0 <= from_i < to_i < n`
* `1 <= weight_i <= 1000`
* All pairs `(from_i, to_i)` are distinct.

## Solution
Sort the edges according to the weights in ascending order. Then generate a minimum spanning tree using Kruskal's algorithm and calculate the total cost of the minimum spanning tree.

After the total cost is obtained, for each edge, try to generate two minimum spanning trees, where the first minimum spanning tree contains the edge and the second minimum spanning tree does not contain the edge. If only the first minimum spanning tree has total cost equal to the total cost of the minimum spanning tree, then it is a critical edge. If both minimum spanning trees have total cost equal to the total cost of the minimum spanning tree, then it is a pseudo-critical edge.
