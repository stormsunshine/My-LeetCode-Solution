# 1712. Ways to Split Array Into Three Subarrays
## Level
Medium

## Description
A split of an integer array is **good** if:

* The array is split into three **non-empty** contiguous subarrays - named `left`, `mid`, `right` respectively from left to right.
* The sum of the elements in `left` is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in `mid`, and the sum of the elements in `mid` is less than or equal to the sum of the elements in `right`.

Given `nums`, an array of **non-negative** integers, return *the number of **good** ways to split `nums`*. As the number may be too large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,1,1]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** The only good way to split nums is [1] [1] [1].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,2,2,5,0]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** There are three good ways of splitting nums:

[1] [2] [2,2,5,0]

[1] [2,2] [2,5,0]

[1,2] [2,2] [5,0]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [3,2,1]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** There is no good way to split nums.

**Constraints:**

* `3 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## Solution
Calculate the prefix sum array of `nums` and determine the maximum possible sum of the elements in `left`.

For each possible sum of elements in `left`, use binary search to determine the maximum end index and the minimum end index of `mid`, which are `maxMidIndex` and `minMidIndex`, and add `maxMidIndex - minMidIndex + 1` to the number of ways.

Finally, return the number of ways.
