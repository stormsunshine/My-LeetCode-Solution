# 1815. Maximum Number of Groups Getting Fresh Donuts
## Level
Hard

## Description
There is a donuts shop that bakes donuts in batches of `batchSize`. They have a rule where they must serve **all** of the donuts of a batch before serving any donuts of the next batch. You are given an integer `batchSize` and an integer array `groups`, where `groups[i]` denotes that there is a group of `groups[i]` customers that will visit the shop. Each customer will get exactly one donut.

When a group visits the shop, all customers of the group must be served before serving any of the following groups. A group will be happy if they all get fresh donuts. That is, the first customer of the group does not receive a donut that was left over from the previous group.

You can freely rearrange the ordering of the groups. Return *the **maximum** possible number of happy groups after rearranging the groups*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** batchSize = 3, groups = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** You can arrange the groups as [6,2,4,5,1,3]. Then the 1st, 2nd, 4th, and 6th groups will be happy.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** batchSize = 4, groups = [1,3,2,5,2,2,1,6]

**Output:** 4

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= batchSize <= 9`
* `1 <= groups.length <= 30`
* `1 <= groups[i] <= 10^9`

## Solution
The aim of this problem is to find a permutation of `groups` such that the number of prefix sums of `groups` that can be divisible by `batchSize` is the most. Use dynamic programming with compressed states to solve this.
