# 1650. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree III
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given two nodes of a binary tree `p` and `q`, return *their lowest common ancestor (LCA)*.

Each node will have a reference to its parent node. The definition for `Node` is below:
```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node parent;
}
```
According to the **[definition of LCA on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowest_common_ancestor)**: "The lowest common ancestor of two nodes p and q in a tree T is the lowest node that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow **a node to be a descendant of itself**)."

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5 since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [1,2], p = 1, q = 2

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 10^5]`.
* `-10^9 <= Node.val <= 10^9`
* All `Node.val` are **unique**.
* `p != q`
* `p` and `q` exist in the tree.

## Solution
Use a set to store nodes. Start from `p` and obtain all the nodes from `p` to the root node using the nodes' parents. Then start from `q` and move towards the root. If a node is already in the set, then the node is a common ancestor of `p` and `q`. The first common ancestor that is in the set is the lowest common ancestor of `p` and `q`.
