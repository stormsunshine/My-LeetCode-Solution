# 1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given an array `points` representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where `points[i] = [x_i, y_i]`.

The cost of connecting two points `[x_i, y_i]` and `[x_j, y_j]` is the **manhattan distance** between them: `|x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j|`, where `|val|` denotes the absolute value of `val`.

Return *the minimum cost to make all points connected*. All points are connected if there is **exactly one** simple path between any two points.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** points = [[0,0],[2,2],[3,10],[5,2],[7,0]]

**Output:** 20

**Explanation:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/08/26/c.png)

We can connect the points as shown above to get the minimum cost of 20.

Notice that there is a unique path between every pair of points.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** points = [[3,12],[-2,5],[-4,1]]

**Output:** 18

**Example 3:**

**Input:** points = [[0,0],[1,1],[1,0],[-1,1]]

**Output:** 4

**Example 4:**

**Input:** points = [[-1000000,-1000000],[1000000,1000000]]

**Output:** 4000000

**Example 5:**

**Input:** points = [[0,0]]

**Output:** 0

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= points.length <= 1000`
* `-10^6 <= x_i, y_i <= 10^6`
* All pairs `(x_i, y_i)` are distinct.

## Solution

This problem is to find a minimum spanning tree, where the distances are calculated as Manhattan distances. Use Kruskal's algorithm to find the edges with shortest costs and return the total cost.
