# 1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given an integer `n`, you must transform it into `0` using the following operations any number of times:

* Change the rightmost (`0-th`) bit in the binary representation of `n`.
* Change the `i-th` bit in the binary representation of `n` if the `(i-1)-th` bit is set to `1` and the `(i-2)-th` through `0-th` bits are set to `0`.

Return *the minimum number of operations to transform `n` into `0`*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 0

**Output:** 0

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 3

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The binary representation of 3 is "11".

"**1**1" -> "**0**1" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.

"0**1**" -> "0**0**" with the 1st operation.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 6

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The binary representation of 6 is "110".

"**1**10" -> "**0**10" with the 2nd operation since the 1st bit is 1 and 0th through 0th bits are 0.

"01**0**" -> "01**1**" with the 1st operation.

"0**1**1" -> "0**0**1" with the 2nd operation since the 0th bit is 1.

"00**1**" -> "00**0**" with the 1st operation.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** n = 9

**Output:** 14

**Example 5:**

**Input:** n = 333

**Output:** 393

**Constraints:**

* `0 <= n <= 10^9`

## Solution
Find the pattern of the results. If `n == 0`, the result is 0. If `n == 1`, the result is 1. If `n` is power of 2 (e.g. `n = 2^k` where `k` is a non-negative integer), the result of `n` can be obtained from the result of `n / 2`. Concretely, let `f(n)` be the result of `n`, then if `n` is power of 2, there is `f(n) = f(n / 2) * 2 + 1`.

For general cases, find the maximum integer `m` such that `m <= n` and `m` is power of 2, and the answer is calculated as `f(m) - f(n - m)`.
