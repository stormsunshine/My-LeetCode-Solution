# 1396. Design Underground System

## Description
Implement the class `UndergroundSystem` that supports three methods:

1. `checkIn(int id, string stationName, int t)`
   * A customer with id card equal to `id`, gets in the station `stationName` at time `t`.
   * A customer can only be checked into one place at a time.

2. `checkOut(int id, string stationName, int t)`
   * A customer with id card equal to id, gets out from the station `stationName` at time `t`.
3. `getAverageTime(string startStation, string endStation) `
   * Returns the average time to travel between the `startStation` and the `endStation`.
   * The average time is computed from all the previous traveling from `startStation` to `endStation` that happened **directly**.
   * Call to `getAverageTime` is always valid.

You can assume all calls to `checkIn` and `checkOut` methods are consistent. That is, if a customer gets in at time **t<sub>1</sub>** at some station, then it gets out at time **t<sub>2</sub>** with **t<sub>2</sub> > t<sub>1</sub>**. All events happen in chronological order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input
["UndergroundSystem","checkIn","checkIn","checkIn","checkOut","checkOut","checkOut","getAverageTime","getAverageTime","checkIn","getAverageTime","checkOut","getAverageTime"]
[[],[45,"Leyton",3],[32,"Paradise",8],[27,"Leyton",10],[45,"Waterloo",15],[27,"Waterloo",20],[32,"Cambridge",22],["Paradise","Cambridge"],["Leyton","Waterloo"],[10,"Leyton",24],["Leyton","Waterloo"],[10,"Waterloo",38],["Leyton","Waterloo"]]

Output
[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,14.0,11.0,null,11.0,null,12.0]

Explanation
UndergroundSystem undergroundSystem = new UndergroundSystem();
undergroundSystem.checkIn(45, "Leyton", 3);
undergroundSystem.checkIn(32, "Paradise", 8);
undergroundSystem.checkIn(27, "Leyton", 10);
undergroundSystem.checkOut(45, "Waterloo", 15);
undergroundSystem.checkOut(27, "Waterloo", 20);
undergroundSystem.checkOut(32, "Cambridge", 22);
undergroundSystem.getAverageTime("Paradise", "Cambridge");       // return 14.0. There was only one travel from "Paradise" (at time 8) to "Cambridge" (at time 22)
undergroundSystem.getAverageTime("Leyton", "Waterloo");          // return 11.0. There were two travels from "Leyton" to "Waterloo", a customer with id=45 from time=3 to time=15 and a customer with id=27 from time=10 to time=20. So the average time is ( (15-3) + (20-10) ) / 2 = 11.0
undergroundSystem.checkIn(10, "Leyton", 24);
undergroundSystem.getAverageTime("Leyton", "Waterloo");          // return 11.0
undergroundSystem.checkOut(10, "Waterloo", 38);
undergroundSystem.getAverageTime("Leyton", "Waterloo");          // return 12.0
```

**Constraints:**

* There will be at most `20000` operations.
* `1 <= id, t <= 10^6`
* All strings consist of uppercase, lowercase English letters and digits.
* `1 <= stationName.length <= 10`
* Answers within `10^-5` of the actual value will be accepted as correct.

## Solution
Use two maps to store each customer's trip and each trip's list of time.

For the constructor, initialize the two maps.

For method `checkIn`, represent the trip as `stationName, t` and store the entry into the first map using `id` and the trip.

For method `checkOut`, first obtain the trip from the first map and obtain the start station and the start time, and then represent the complete trip as `startStation, endStation` where `endStation` is `stationName` in the method, and calculate the duration as the difference between the end time `t` and the start time. Then add the duration into the complete trip's time list, store the complete trip and the duration list into the second map, and remove the `id` from the first map.

For method `getAverageTime`, use the start station and the end station to obtain the list of time, and calculate the average of all elements in the list.
