# 1861. Rotating the Box
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given an `m x n` matrix of characters `box` representing a side-view of a box. Each cell of the box is one of the following:

* A stone `'#'`
* A stationary obstacle `'*'`
* Empty `'.'`

The box is rotated **90 degrees clockwise**, causing some of the stones to fall due to gravity. Each stone falls down until it lands on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box. Gravity **does not** affect the obstacles' positions, and the inertia from the box's rotation **does not** affect the stones' horizontal positions.

It is **guaranteed** that each stone in `box` rests on an obstacle, another stone, or the bottom of the box.

Return **an `n x m` matrix representing the box after the rotation described above**.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: box = [["#",".","#"]]
Output: [["."],
         ["#"],
         ["#"]]
```
**Example 2:**

```
Input: box = [["#",".","*","."],
              ["#","#","*","."]]
Output: [["#","."],
         ["#","#"],
         ["*","*"],
         [".","."]]
```
**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/rotatingtheboxleetcode3withstone.png)

```
Input: box = [["#","#","*",".","*","."],
              ["#","#","#","*",".","."],
              ["#","#","#",".","#","."]]
Output: [[".","#","#"],
         [".","#","#"],
         ["#","#","*"],
         ["#","*","."],
         ["#",".","*"],
         ["#",".","."]]
```

**Constraints:**

* `m == box.length`
* `n == box[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 500`
* `box[i][j]` is either `'#'`, `'*'`, or `'.'`.

## Solution
First, move the stones to the rightmost positions considering the border of the box and the obstacles. Then rotate `box` 90 degrees clockwise.
