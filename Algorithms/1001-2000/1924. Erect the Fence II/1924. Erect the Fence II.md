# 1924. Erect the Fence II
## Level
Hard

## Description
You are given a 2D integer array `trees` where `trees[i] = [x_i, y_i]` represents the location of the `i-th` tree in the garden.

You are asked to fence the entire garden using the minimum length of rope possible. The garden is well-fenced only if **all the trees are enclosed** and the rope used **forms a perfect circle**. A tree is considered enclosed if it is inside or on the border of the circle.

More formally, you must form a circle using the rope with a center `(x, y)` and radius `r` where all trees lie inside or on the circle and `r` is **minimum**.

Return *the center and radius of the circle as a length 3 array `[x, y, r]`*. Answers within `10-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** trees = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,0],[2,4],[3,3],[4,2]]

**Output:** [2.00000,2.00000,2.00000]

**Explanation:** The fence will have center = (2, 2) and radius = 2

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/07/06/trees2.png)

**Input:** trees = [[1,2],[2,2],[4,2]]

**Output:** [2.50000,2.00000,1.50000]

**Explanation:** The fence will have center = (2.5, 2) and radius = 1.5

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= trees.length <= 3000`
* `trees[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= x_i, y_i <= 3000`

## Solution
This problem is the smallest-circle problem. Use Welzl's algorithm to find the smallest circle's center and radius.
