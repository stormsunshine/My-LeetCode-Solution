# 1941. Check if All Characters Have Equal Number of Occurrences
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a string `s`, return *`true` if `s` is a **good** string, or `false` otherwise*.

A string `s` is **good** if **all** the characters that appear in `s` have the **same** number of occurrences (i.e., the same frequency).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "abacbc"

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** The characters that appear in s are 'a', 'b', and 'c'. All characters occur 2 times in s.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "aaabb"

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** The characters that appear in s are 'a' and 'b'.
'a' occurs 3 times while 'b' occurs 2 times, which is not the same number of times.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solution
Use a hash map to store each character's number of occurrences in `s`. The length of `s` should be divisible by the hash map's size, and each character's number of occurrences should be the same. In this case, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.
