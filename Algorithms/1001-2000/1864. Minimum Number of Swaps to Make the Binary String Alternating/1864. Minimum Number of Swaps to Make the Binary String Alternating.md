# 1864. Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the Binary String Alternating
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary string `s`, return *the **minimum** number of character swaps to make it **alternating**, or `-1` if it is impossible*.

The string is called **alternating** if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the strings `"010"` and `"1010"` are alternating, while the string `"0100"` is not.

Any two characters may be swapped, even if they are **not adjacent**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "111000"

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** Swap positions 1 and 4: "111000" -> "101010"
The string is now alternating.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "010"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** The string is already alternating, no swaps are needed.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "1110"

**Output:** -1

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
* `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Solution
Since swapping cannot change the characters in the string, the number of zeros and ones will not change. So first count the number of zeros and ones in `s`. If the counts differ by more than 1, return -1.

Otherwise, the alternating string can either start with 0 or 1, or only one of the characters if the length of `s` is odd. For each possible alternating string, calculate the number of swaps needed, and return the minimum number of swaps.
