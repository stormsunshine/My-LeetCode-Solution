# 1931. Painting a Grid With Three Different Colors
## Level
Hard

## Description
You are given two integers `m` and `n`. Consider an `m x n` grid where each cell is initially white. You can paint each cell **red**, **green**, or **blue**. All cells **must** be painted.

Return *the number of ways to color the grid with **no two adjacent cells having the same color***. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** m = 1, n = 1

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The three possible colorings are shown in the image above.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** m = 1, n = 2

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** The six possible colorings are shown in the image above.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** m = 5, n = 5

**Output:** 580986

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= m <= 5`
* `1 <= n <= 1000`

## Solution
There are `m` rows and `n` columns. For each column, precalculate all legal states such that no two adjacent cells have the same color, and precalculate all pairs of column states that can be two adjacent columns. Then for each column, calculate the number of ways to paint all columns up to the column. Finally, return the number of ways to paint all `n` columns.
