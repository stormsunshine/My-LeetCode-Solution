# 1545. Find Kth Bit in Nth Binary String
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given two positive integers `n` and `k`, the binary string `S_n` is formed as follows:

* `S_1 = "0"`
* `S_i = S_i-1 + "1" + reverse(invert(S_i-1))` for `i > 1`

Where + denotes the concatenation operation, `reverse(x)` returns the reversed string x, and `invert(x)` inverts all the bits in x (0 changes to 1 and 1 changes to 0).

For example, the first 4 strings in the above sequence are:

* `S1 = "0"`
* `S2 = "011"`
* `S3 = "0111001"`
* `S4 = "011100110110001"`

Return *the `k-th` bit* in `S_n`. It is guaranteed that `k` is valid for the given `n`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, k = 1

**Output:** "0"

**Explanation:** S_3 is "0111001". The first bit is "0".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 4, k = 11

**Output:** "1"

**Explanation:** S_4 is "011100110110001". The 11th bit is "1".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 1, k = 1

**Output:** "0"

**Example 4:**

**Input:** n = 2, k = 3

**Output:** "1"

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 20`
* `1 <= k <= 2^n - 1`

## Solution
Since `n` is at most 20, it is possible to directly generate the string `S_n`. After `S_n` is generated, return the `k-th` bit in `S_n`.
