# 1869. Longer Contiguous Segments of Ones than Zeros
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a binary string `s`, return `true` *if the **longest** contiguous segment of `1`s is **strictly longer** than the **longest** contiguous segment of `0`s in `s`. Return `false` otherwise*.

* For example, in `s = "110100010"` the longest contiguous segment of `1`s has length `2`, and the longest contiguous segment of `0`s has length `3`.

Note that if there are no `0`s, then the longest contiguous segment of `0`s is considered to have length `0`. The same applies if there are no `1`s.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "1101"

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 2: "1101"

The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 1: "1101"

The segment of 1s is longer, so return true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "111000"

**Output:** false

**Explanation:**

The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 3: "111000"

The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 3: "111000"

The segment of 1s is not longer, so return false.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "110100010"

**Output:** false

**Explanation:**

The longest contiguous segment of 1s has length 2: "110100010"

The longest contiguous segment of 0s has length 3: "110100010"

The segment of 1s is not longer, so return false.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 100`
* `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Solution
Loop over `s` and calculate the lengths of the longest contiguous segment of 0's and the longest contiguous segment of 1's. Then compare the two lengths and return `true` if the longest contiguous segment of 0's is strictly greater, or `false` otherwise.
