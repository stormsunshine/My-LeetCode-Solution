# 1770. Maximum Score from Performing Multiplication Operations
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given two integer arrays `nums` and `multipliers` of size `n` and `m` respectively, where `n >= m`. The arrays are **1-indexed**.

You begin with a score of `0`. You want to perform **exactly** `m` operations. On the `i-th` operation **(1-indexed)**, you will:

* Choose one integer `x` from **either the start or the end** of the array `nums`.
* Add `multipliers[i] * x` to your score.
* Remove `x` from the array nums.

Return *the **maximum score** after performing `m` operations*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], multipliers = [3,2,1]

**Output:** 14

**Explanation:** An optimal solution is as follows:
- Choose from the end, [1,2,3], adding 3 * 3 = 9 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [1,2], adding 2 * 2 = 4 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [1], adding 1 * 1 = 1 to the score.

The total score is 9 + 4 + 1 = 14.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], multipliers = [-10,-5,3,4,6]

**Output:** 102

**Explanation:** An optimal solution is as follows:
- Choose from the start, [-5,-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -5 * -10 = 50 to the score.
- Choose from the start, [-3,-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * -5 = 15 to the score.
- Choose from the start, [-3,-2,7,1], adding -3 * 3 = -9 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [-2,7,1], adding 1 * 4 = 4 to the score.
- Choose from the end, [-2,7], adding 7 * 6 = 42 to the score. 

The total score is 50 + 15 - 9 + 4 + 42 = 102.

**Constraints:**

* `n == nums.length`
* `m == multipliers.length`
* `1 <= m <= 10^3`
* `m <= n <= 10^5`
* `-1000 <= nums[i], multipliers[i] <= 1000`

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `dp` of `m + 1` rows and `n` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum score using the last `i` multiplers for the subarray starting from index `j`. The base case is when `i = 1`. The final result is `dp[m][0]`.

To optimize memory, use a 1D array instead, which stores only the last row of the original `dp` array.
