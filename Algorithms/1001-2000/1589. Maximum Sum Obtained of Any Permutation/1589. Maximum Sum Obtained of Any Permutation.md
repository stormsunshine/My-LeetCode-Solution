# 1589. Maximum Sum Obtained of Any Permutation
## Level
Medium

## Description
We have an array of integers, `nums`, and an array of `requests` where `requests[i] = [start_i, end_i]`. The `i-th` request asks for the sum of `nums[start_i] + nums[start_i + 1] + ... + nums[end_i - 1] + nums[end_i]`. Both `start_i` and `end_i` are 0-indexed.

Return *the maximum total sum of all requests **among all permutations** of `nums`*.

Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5], requests = [[1,3],[0,1]]

**Output:** 19

**Explanation:** One permutation of nums is [2,1,3,4,5] with the following result: 

requests[0] -> nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[3] = 1 + 3 + 4 = 8

requests[1] -> nums[0] + nums[1] = 2 + 1 = 3

Total sum: 8 + 3 = 11.

A permutation with a higher total sum is [3,5,4,2,1] with the following result:

requests[0] -> nums[1] + nums[2] + nums[3] = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11

requests[1] -> nums[0] + nums[1] = 3 + 5  = 8

Total sum: 11 + 8 = 19, which is the best that you can do.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6], requests = [[0,1]]

**Output:** 11

**Explanation:** A permutation with the max total sum is [6,5,4,3,2,1] with request sums [11].

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5,10], requests = [[0,2],[1,3],[1,1]]

**Output:** 47

**Explanation:** A permutation with the max total sum is [4,10,5,3,2,1] with request sums [19,18,10].

**Constraints:**

* `n == nums.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
* `1 <= requests.length <= 10^5`
* `requests[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= start_i <= end_i < n`

## Solution
Use the array `requests` to calculate the number of requests at each index. To maximize the total sum of all requests, the greatest values should have the greatest numbers of requests. Therefore, sort both `nums` and the number of requests at each index, and calculate the maximum possible sum.
