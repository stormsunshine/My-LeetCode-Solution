# 1802. Maximum Value at a Given Index in a Bounded Array
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given three positive integers `n`, `index` and `maxSum`. You want to construct an array `nums` **(0-indexed)** that satisfies the following conditions:

* `nums.length == n`
* `nums[i]` is a **positive** integer where `0 <= i < n`.
* `abs(nums[i] - nums[i+1]) <= 1` where `0 <= i < n-1`.
* The sum of all the elements of `nums` does not exceed `maxSum`.
* `nums[index]` is **maximized**.

Return `nums[index]` of the constructed array.

Note that `abs(x)` equals `x` if `x >= 0`, and `-x` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, index = 2,  maxSum = 6

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The arrays [1,1,**2**,1] and [1,2,**2**,1] satisfy all the conditions. There are no other valid arrays with a larger value at the given index.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 6, index = 1,  maxSum = 10

**Output:** 3

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= maxSum <= 10^9`
* `0 <= index < n`

## Solution
Use binary search. Initialize `low = 1` and `high = maxSum`. Each time calculate `mid` as the mean of `low` and `high`, and calculate the minimum possible sum of `nums` when `nums[index] = mid`. If the minimum possible sum is greater than `maxSum`, let `high = mid - 1`. Otherwise, let `low = mid`. Finally, the answer is `low`.

Note that all elements in `nums` must be positive, which should be considered during binary search.
