# 1847. Closest Room
## Level
Hard

## Description
There is a hotel with `n` rooms. The rooms are represented by a 2D integer array `rooms` where `rooms[i] = [roomId_i, size_i]` denotes that there is a room with room number `roomId_i` and size equal to `size_i`. Each `roomId_i` is guaranteed to be **unique**.

You are also given `k` queries in a 2D array `queries` where `queries[j] = [preferred_j, minSize_j]`. The answer to the `j-th` query is the room number `id` of a room such that:

* The room has a size of **at least** `minSize_j`, and
* `abs(id - preferred_j)` is **minimized**, where `abs(x)` is the absolute value of `x`.

If there is a **tie** in the absolute difference, then use the room with the **smallest** such `id`. If there is **no such room**, the answer is `-1`.

Return *an array `answer` of length `k` where `answer[j]` contains the answer to the `j-th` query*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** rooms = [[2,2],[1,2],[3,2]], queries = [[3,1],[3,3],[5,2]]

**Output:** [3,-1,3]

**Explanation:** The answers to the queries are as follows:

Query = [3,1]: Room number 3 is the closest as abs(3 - 3) = 0, and its size of 2 is at least 1. The answer is 3.

Query = [3,3]: There are no rooms with a size of at least 3, so the answer is -1.

Query = [5,2]: Room number 3 is the closest as abs(3 - 5) = 2, and its size of 2 is at least 2. The answer is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** rooms = [[1,4],[2,3],[3,5],[4,1],[5,2]], queries = [[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]

**Output:** [2,1,3]

**Explanation:** The answers to the queries are as follows:

Query = [2,3]: Room number 2 is the closest as abs(2 - 2) = 0, and its size of 3 is at least 3. The answer is 2.

Query = [2,4]: Room numbers 1 and 3 both have sizes of at least 4. The answer is 1 since it is smaller.

Query = [2,5]: Room number 3 is the only room with a size of at least 5. The answer is 3.

**Constraints:**

* `n == rooms.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `k == queries.length`
* `1 <= k <= 10^4`
* `1 <= roomId_i, preferred_j <= 10^7`
* `1 <= size_i, minSize_j <= 10^7`

## Solution
Sort `rooms` according to sizes in decreasing order. Sort `queries` according to `minSize`s in decreasing order, and store the queries' indices in the original `queries`.

Use a tree set to store the room numbers. Loop over the sorted queries. For each query, loop over the sorted `rooms` and add all the rooms that have sizes greater than or equal to the current query's `minSize` to the tree set. Then use `preferred` to find the two closest room numbers in the tree set, which are `floor` and `ceiling`. If neither `floor` nor `ceiling` exists, the query result is -1. If only one of `floor` and `ceiling` exists, the query result is the one that exists. If both `floor` and `ceiling` exist, then calculate the differences and the query result is the one with the minimum difference.
