## Level
Easy

## Description
You are given `coordinates`, a string that represents the coordinates of a square of the chessboard. Below is a chessboard for your reference.

Return `true` *if the square is white, and* `false` *if the square is black*.

The coordinate will always represent a valid chessboard square. The coordinate will always have the letter first, and the number second.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** coordinates = "a1"

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** From the chessboard above, the square with coordinates "a1" is black, so return false.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** coordinates = "h3"

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** From the chessboard above, the square with coordinates "h3" is white, so return true.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** coordinates = "c7"

**Output:** false

**Constraints:**

* `coordinates.length == 2`
* `'a' <= coordinates[0] <= 'h'`
* `'1' <= coordinates[1] <= '8'`

## Solution
Convert `coordinates` into two integers, which represent the column and the row of the square. Both the column and the row range from 1 to 8. The square is white if and only if the column is odd and the row is even, or the column is even and the row is odd.
