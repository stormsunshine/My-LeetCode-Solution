# 1758. Minimum Changes To Make Alternating Binary String
## Level
Easy

## Description
You are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters `'0'` and `'1'`. In one operation, you can change any `'0'` to `'1'` or vice versa.

The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the string `"010"` is alternating, while the string `"0100"` is not.

Return *the **minimum** number of operations needed to make `s` alternating*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "0100"

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** If you change the last character to '1', s will be "0101", which is alternating.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "10"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** s is already alternating.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "1111"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** You need two operations to reach "0101" or "1010".

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
* `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Solution
If the first character of an alternating string is determined, the whole string can be determined. The first character of an alternating string can be either `'0'` or `'1'`. Calculate the number of operations for both cases to make `s` alternating, and return the minimum number of operations.
