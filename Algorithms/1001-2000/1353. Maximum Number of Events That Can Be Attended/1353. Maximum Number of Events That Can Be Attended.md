# 1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of events where `events[i] = [startDay_i, endDay_i]`. Every event `i` starts at `startDay_i` and ends at `endDay_i`.

You can attend an event `i` at any day `d` where `startTime_i <= d <= endTime_i`. Notice that you can only attend one event at any time `d`.

Return *the maximum number of events* you can attend.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** events = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** You can attend all the three events.

One way to attend them all is as shown.

Attend the first event on day 1.

Attend the second event on day 2.

Attend the third event on day 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** events= [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,2]]

**Output:** 4

**Example 3:**

**Input:** events = [[1,4],[4,4],[2,2],[3,4],[1,1]]

**Output:** 4

**Example 4:**

**Input:** events = [[1,100000]]

**Output:** 1

**Example 5:**

**Input:** events = [[1,1],[1,2],[1,3],[1,4],[1,5],[1,6],[1,7]]

**Output:** 7

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= events.length <= 10^5`
* `events[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= events[i][0] <= events[i][1] <= 10^5`

## Solution
Use a priority queue to store the elements in `events`, where the elements are sorted according to the start days in ascending order and then according to the end days in ascending order. Therefore, the event with the smallest start day and the smallest end day is polled from the priority queue first.

Maintain `curDay` that stores the current day of an event. Each time poll an event from the priority queue, and update `curDay` to the event's start day if `curDay` is smaller than the event's start day. If `curDay` does not exceed the event's end day, then increase the counter by 1 and increase `curDay` by 1, which means the next event to be attended must be on the next day or after the next day. Then for the remaining elements in the priority queue, if an event's start day is smaller than the updated `curDay`, update the event's start day to `curDay` so that the priorities are recalculated. The update is necessary since the days that have already been occupied can't be used to attend other events, the remaining events' start days must be updated to the smallest possible start days.

Finally, return the counter.
