# 1720. Decode XORed Array
## Level
Easy

## Description
There is a **hidden** integer array `arr` that consists of n non-negative integers.

It was encoded into another integer array `encoded` of length `n - 1`, such that `encoded[i] = arr[i] XOR arr[i + 1]`. For example, if `arr = [1,0,2,1]`, then `encoded = [1,2,3]`.

You are given the `encoded` array. You are also given an integer `first`, that is the first element of `arr`, i.e. `arr[0]`.

Return *the original array `arr`*. It can be proved that the answer exists and is unique.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** encoded = [1,2,3], first = 1

**Output:** [1,0,2,1]

**Explanation:** If arr = [1,0,2,1], then first = 1 and encoded = [1 XOR 0, 0 XOR 2, 2 XOR 1] = [1,2,3]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** encoded = [6,2,7,3], first = 4

**Output:** [4,2,0,7,4]

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 10^4`
* `encoded.length == n - 1`
* `0 <= encoded[i] <= 10^5`
* `0 <= first <= 10^5`

## Solution
Create an array `arr` of length `n + 1` and set `arr[0] = first`. Then use the property of XOR such that if `a ^ b == c` then there is `a ^ c == b` and `b ^ c == a`. Therefore, for each `i` from `0` to `n - 1`, there is `arr[i + 1] = arr[i] ^ encoded[i]`. Finally, return `arr`.
