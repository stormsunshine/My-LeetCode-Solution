# 1663. Smallest String With A Given Numeric Value
## Level
Medium

## Description
The **numeric value** of a lowercase character is defined as its position `(1-indexed)` in the alphabet, so the numeric value of `a` is `1`, the numeric value of `b` is `2`, the numeric value of `c` is `3`, and so on.

The **numeric value** of a **string** consisting of lowercase characters is defined as the sum of its characters' numeric values. For example, the numeric value of the string `"abe"` is equal to `1 + 2 + 5 = 8`.

You are given two integers n and k. Return *the **lexicographically smallest string** with **length** equal to `n` and **numeric value** equal to `k`*.

Note that a string `x` is lexicographically smaller than string `y` if `x` comes before `y` in dictionary order, that is, either `x` is a prefix of `y`, or if `i` is the first position such that `x[i] != y[i]`, then `x[i]` comes before `y[i]` in alphabetic order.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, k = 27

**Output:** "aay"

**Explanation:** The numeric value of the string is 1 + 1 + 25 = 27, and it is the smallest string with such a value and length equal to 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5, k = 73

**Output:** "aaszz"

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `n <= k <= 26 * n`

## Solution
If a string of length `n` is the smallest, then the characters at the start of the string should be as small as possible.

Create an array of length `n` with type `int`. Loop over `i` from 0 to `n - 1`. For each `i`, calculate the remain sum as `26 * (n - i - 1)`, and `array[i]` should be at least `k - remainSum` so that the string can fit in length `n`. Also, `array[i]` should be at least 1. Fill all the elements in `array`.

Then generate the smallest string from `array`. The elements 1 to 26 correspond to `'a'` to `'z'` respectively.
