# 1828. Queries on Number of Points Inside a Circle
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given an array `points` where `points[i] = [x_i, y_i]` is the coordinates of the `i-th` point on a 2D plane. Multiple points can have the **same** coordinates.

You are also given an array `queries` where `queries[j] = [x_j, y_j, r_j]` describes a circle centered at `(x_j, y_j)` with a radius of `r_j`.

For each query `queries[j]`, compute the number of points **inside** the `j-th` circle. Points **on the border** of the circle are considered **inside**.

Return *an array `answer`, where `answer[j]` is the answer to the `j-th` query*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** points = [[1,3],[3,3],[5,3],[2,2]], queries = [[2,3,1],[4,3,1],[1,1,2]]

**Output:** [3,2,2]

**Explanation:** The points and circles are shown above.

queries[0] is the green circle, queries[1] is the red circle, and queries[2] is the blue circle.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/03/25/chrome_2021-03-25_22-42-07.png)

**Input:** points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]], queries = [[1,2,2],[2,2,2],[4,3,2],[4,3,3]]

**Output:** [2,3,2,4]

**Explanation:** The points and circles are shown above.

queries[0] is green, queries[1] is red, queries[2] is blue, and queries[3] is purple.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= points.length <= 500`
* `points[i].length == 2`
* `0 <= x_i, y​​​​​​_i <= 500`
* `1 <= queries.length <= 500`
* `queries[j].length == 3`
* `0 <= x_j, y_j <= 500`
* `1 <= r_j <= 500`
* All coordinates are integers.

## Solution
For each query, obtain the values `x`, `y` and `r`, and for each point, calculate the squared distance between the query's center and the point. If the squared distance is less than or equal to `r * r`, then the point is inside the circle. The number of points inside each circle can be calculated.
