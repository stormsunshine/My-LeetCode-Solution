# 1735. Count Ways to Make Array With Product
## Level
Hard

## Description
You are given a 2D integer array, `queries`. For each `queries[i]`, where `queries[i] = [n_i, k_i]`, find the number of different ways you can place positive integers into an array of size ni such that the product of the integers is `k_i`. As the number of ways may be too large, the answer to the `i-th` query is the number of ways **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

Return *an integer array `answer` where `answer.length == queries.length`, and `answer[i]` is the answer to the `i-th` query*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** queries = [[2,6],[5,1],[73,660]]

**Output:** [4,1,50734910]

**Explanation:** Each query is independent.

[2,6]: There are 4 ways to fill an array of size 2 that multiply to 6: [1,6], [2,3], [3,2], [6,1].

[5,1]: There is 1 way to fill an array of size 5 that multiply to 1: [1,1,1,1,1].

[73,660]: There are 1050734917 ways to fill an array of size 73 that multiply to 660. 1050734917 modulo 109 + 7 = 50734910.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** queries = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3],[4,4],[5,5]]

**Output:** [1,2,3,10,5]

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= queries.length <= 10^4`
* `1 <= n_i, k_i <= 10^4`

## Solution
First, get all combination numbers for all possible values of `n` and `k`. Next, for each query `(n, k)`, do prime factorization for `k` and calculate the number of ways using the combination numbers and the prime factorization results of `k`.
