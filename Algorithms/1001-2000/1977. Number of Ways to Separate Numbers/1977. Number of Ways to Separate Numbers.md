# 1977. Number of Ways to Separate Numbers
## Level
Hard

## Description
You wrote down many **positive** integers in a string called `num`. However, you realized that you forgot to add commas to seperate the different numbers. You remember that the list of integers was **non-decreasing** and that **no** integer had leading zeros.

Return *the **number of possible lists of integers** that you could have written down to get the string `num`*. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = "327"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** You could have written down the numbers:

3, 27

327

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = "094"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** No numbers can have leading zeros and all numbers must be positive.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** num = "0"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** No numbers can have leading zeros and all numbers must be positive.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** num = "9999999999999"

**Output:** 101

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= num.length <= 3500`
* `num` consists of digits `'0'` through `'9'`.

## Solution
Use dynamic programming with precalculation. First, precalculate the longest common prefixes of each pair of substrings. Next, use dynamic programming to count the number of ways.
