# 1430. Check If a String Is a Valid Sequence from Root to Leaves Path in a Binary Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree where each path going from the root to any leaf form a **valid sequence**, check if a given string is a **valid sequence** in such binary tree. 

We get the given string from the concatenation of an array of integers `arr` and the concatenation of all values of the nodes along a path results in a `sequence` in the given binary tree.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [0,1,0,0,1,0,null,null,1,0,0], arr = [0,1,0,1]

**Output:** true

**Explanation:**

The path 0 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1 is a valid sequence (green color in the figure).

Other valid sequences are:

0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0

0 -> 0 -> 0

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [0,1,0,0,1,0,null,null,1,0,0], arr = [0,0,1]

**Output:** false 

**Explanation:** The path 0 -> 0 -> 1 does not exist, therefore it is not even a sequence.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [0,1,0,0,1,0,null,null,1,0,0], arr = [0,1,1]

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** The path 0 -> 1 -> 1 is a sequence, but it is not a valid sequence.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr.length <= 5000`
* `0 <= arr[i] <= 9`
* Each node's value is between [0 - 9].

## Solution
Use breadth first search. Each time all nodes in the same level are visited, and only the nodes with the corresponding value in `arr` are considered. If a valid path exists such that it starts from the root and ends at a leaf, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.
