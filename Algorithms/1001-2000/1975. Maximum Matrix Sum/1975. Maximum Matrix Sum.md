# 1975. Maximum Matrix Sum
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given an `n x n` integer `matrix`. You can do the following operation **any** number of times:

* Choose any two **adjacent** elements of `matrix` and **multiply** each of them by `-1`.

Two elements are considered **adjacent** if and only if they share a **border**.

Your goal is to **maximize** the summation of the matrix's elements. Return *the **maximum** sum of the matrix's elements using the operation mentioned above*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** matrix = [[1,-1],[-1,1]]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** We can follow the following steps to reach sum equals 4:
- Multiply the 2 elements in the first row by -1.
- Multiply the 2 elements in the first column by -1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** matrix = [[1,2,3],[-1,-2,-3],[1,2,3]]

**Output:** 16

**Explanation:** We can follow the following step to reach sum equals 16:
- Multiply the 2 last elements in the second row by -1.

**Constraints:**

* `n == matrix.length == matrix[i].length`
* `2 <= n <= 250`
* `-10^5 <= matrix[i][j] <= 10^5`

## Solution
To get the maximum matrix sum, at most one element can be negative after performing the operation any number of times. If there is no element 0 and the number of negative elements is odd, then there has to be one negative element. Otherwise, all elements can be non-negative. If there has to be one negative element, it should have the minimum absolute value. Therefore, find the element with the minimum absolute value and make it negative if there has to be one negative element (the element can be positive in the original matrix), and calculate the sum of elements in the matrix.
