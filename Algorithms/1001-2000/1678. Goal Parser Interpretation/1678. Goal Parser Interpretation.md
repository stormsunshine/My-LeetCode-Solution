# 1678. Goal Parser Interpretation
## Level
Easy

## Description
You own a **Goal Parser** that can interpret a string `command`. The `command` consists of an alphabet of `"G"`, `"()"` and/or `"(al)"` in some order. The Goal Parser will interpret `"G"` as the string `"G"`, `"()"` as the string `"o"`, and `"(al)"` as the string `"al"`. The interpreted strings are then concatenated in the original order.

Given the string `command`, *return the **Goal Parser**'s interpretation of `command`*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** command = "G()(al)"

**Output:** "Goal"

**Explanation:** The Goal Parser interprets the command as follows:

G -> G

() -> o

(al) -> al

The final concatenated result is "Goal".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** command = "G()()()()(al)"

**Output:** "Gooooal"

**Example 3:**

**Input:** command = "(al)G(al)()()G"

**Output:** "alGalooG"

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= command.length <= 100`
* `command` consists of `"G"`, `"()"`, and/or `"(al)"` in some order.

## Solution
Since the given `command` is always valid, simply replace all occurrences of `"(al)"` with `"al"` and replace all occurrences of `"()"` with `"o"`, and return the replaced string.
