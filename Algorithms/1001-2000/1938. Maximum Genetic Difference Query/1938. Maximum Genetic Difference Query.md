# 1938. Maximum Genetic Difference Query
## Level
Hard

## Description
There is a rooted tree consisting of `n` nodes numbered `0` to `n - 1`. Each node's number denotes its **unique genetic value** (i.e. the genetic value of node `x` is `x`). The **genetic difference** between two genetic values is defined as the **bitwise-XOR** of their values. You are given the integer array `parents`, where `parents[i]` is the parent for node `i`. If node `x` is the **root** of the tree, then `parents[x] == -1`.

You are also given the array `queries` where `queries[i] = [node_i, val_i]`. For each query `i`, find the **maximum genetic difference** between `val_i` and `p_i`, where `p_i` is the genetic value of any node that is on the path between `node_i` and the root (including `node_i` and the root). More formally, you want to maximize `val_i XOR p_i`.

Return *an array `ans` where `ans[i]` is the answer to the `i-th` query*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** parents = [-1,0,1,1], queries = [[0,2],[3,2],[2,5]]

**Output:** [2,3,7]

**Explanation:** The queries are processed as follows:
- [0,2]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 0, with a difference of 2 XOR 0 = 2.
- [3,2]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 1, with a difference of 2 XOR 1 = 3.
- [2,5]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 2, with a difference of 5 XOR 2 = 7.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** parents = [3,7,-1,2,0,7,0,2], queries = [[4,6],[1,15],[0,5]]

**Output:** [6,14,7]

**Explanation:** The queries are processed as follows:
- [4,6]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 0, with a difference of 6 XOR 0 = 6.
- [1,15]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 1, with a difference of 15 XOR 1 = 14.
- [0,5]: The node with the maximum genetic difference is 2, with a difference of 5 XOR 2 = 7.

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= parents.length <= 10^5`
* `0 <= parents[i] <= parents.length - 1` for every node `i` that is **not** the root.
* `parents[root] == -1`
* `1 <= queries.length <= 3 * 10^4`
* `0 <= node_i <= parents.length - 1`
* `0 <= val_i <= 2 * 10^5`

## Solution
Create a trie that stores the numbers in `nums`. Each node in the trie has two children that represent bits 0 and 1, respectively. For each number, create the trie from the highest bit to the lowest bit, where all the numbers have at most 18 bits. For each node in the trie, maintain the number of times that the node is passed by.

Then do depth first search on the trie starting from the root to obtain the query results.

Finally, return the query results.
