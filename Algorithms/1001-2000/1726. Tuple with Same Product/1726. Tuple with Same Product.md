## Description
Given an array `nums` of **distinct** positive integers, return *the number of tuples `(a, b, c, d)` such that `a * b = c * d` where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are elements of `nums`, and `a != b != c != d`*.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,3,4,6]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 valid tuples:
(2,6,3,4) , (2,6,4,3) , (6,2,3,4) , (6,2,4,3)
(3,4,2,6) , (3,4,2,6) , (3,4,6,2) , (4,3,6,2)
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,4,5,10]
Output: 16
Explanation: There are 16 valids tuples:
(1,10,2,5) , (1,10,5,2) , (10,1,2,5) , (10,1,5,2)
(2,5,1,10) , (2,5,10,1) , (5,2,1,10) , (5,2,10,1)
(2,10,4,5) , (2,10,5,4) , (10,2,4,5) , (10,2,4,5)
(4,5,2,10) , (4,5,10,2) , (5,4,2,10) , (5,4,10,2)
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [2,3,4,6,8,12]
Output: 40
```
**Example 4:**
```
Input: nums = [2,3,5,7]
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
* All elements in `nums` are **distinct**.

## Solution
Loop over all pairs of elements in `nums`. For each pair of elements, calculate the two elements' product. Use a hash map to store each product and the number of pairs `(a, b)` such that `a * b` equals the product.

Then loop over all entries of the map. For each product, if the number of pairs is `count`, then the number of tuples of the same product as the current product is `count * (count - 1) * 4`.

Finally, return the number of tuples.
