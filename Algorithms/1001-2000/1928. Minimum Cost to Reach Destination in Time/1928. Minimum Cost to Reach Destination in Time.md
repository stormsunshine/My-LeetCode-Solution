# 1928. Minimum Cost to Reach Destination in Time
## Level
Hard

## Description
There is a country of `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n - 1` where **all the cities are connected** by bi-directional roads. The roads are represented as a 2D integer array edges where `edges[i] = [x_i, y_i, time_i]` denotes a road between cities `x_i` and `y_i` that takes `time_i` minutes to travel. There may be multiple roads of differing travel times connecting the same two cities, but no road connects a city to itself.

Each time you pass through a city, you must pay a passing fee. This is represented as a **0-indexed** integer array `passingFees` of length `n` where `passingFees[j]` is the amount of dollars you must pay when you pass through city `j`.

In the beginning, you are at city `0` and want to reach city `n - 1` in **`maxTime` minutes or less**. The **cost** of your journey is the **summation of passing fees** for each city that you passed through at some moment of your journey (**including** the source and destination cities).

Given `maxTime`, `edges`, and `passingFees`, return *the **minimum cost** to complete your journey, or `-1` if you cannot complete it within `maxTime` minutes*.

**Example 1:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/leetgraph1-1.png)

**Input:** maxTime = 30, edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[2,5,10],[0,3,1],[3,4,10],[4,5,15]], passingFees = [5,1,2,20,20,3]

**Output:** 11

**Explanation:** The path to take is 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5, which takes 30 minutes and has $11 worth of passing fees.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/04/copy-of-leetgraph1-1.png)

**Input:** maxTime = 29, edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[2,5,10],[0,3,1],[3,4,10],[4,5,15]], passingFees = [5,1,2,20,20,3]
Output: 48

**Explanation:** The path to take is 0 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5, which takes 26 minutes and has $48 worth of passing fees.

You cannot take path 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 5 since it would take too long.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** maxTime = 25, edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,10],[2,5,10],[0,3,1],[3,4,10],[4,5,15]], passingFees = [5,1,2,20,20,3]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:** There is no way to reach city 5 from city 0 within 25 minutes.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= maxTime <= 1000`
* `n == passingFees.length`
* `2 <= n <= 1000`
* `n - 1 <= edges.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= x_i, y_i <= n - 1`
* `1 <= time_i <= 1000`
* `1 <= passingFees[j] <= 1000 `
* The graph may contain multiple edges between two nodes.
* The graph does not contain self loops.

## Solution
First, use maps to store each city's adjacent cities and corresponding times. Next, use dynamic programming to find the minimum cost. Create a 2D array `costs` where `costs[i][j]` is the minimum cost to reach `i` at time `j`, with `0 <= i < n` and `0 <= j <= maxTime`. Starting from city 0, find the minimum values of all elements in `costs`. Finally, return the minimum value in `costs[n - 1]`, or -1 if it is impossible to reach city `n - 1` within `maxTime`.
