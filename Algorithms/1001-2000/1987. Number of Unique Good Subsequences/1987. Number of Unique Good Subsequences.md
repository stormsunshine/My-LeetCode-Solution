# 1987. Number of Unique Good Subsequences
## Level
Hard

## Description
You are given a binary string `binary`. A **subsequence** of `binary` is considered **good** if it is **not empty** and has **no leading zeros** (with the exception of `"0"`).

Find the number of **unique good subsequences** of `binary`.

* For example, if `binary = "001"`, then all the **good** subsequences are `["0", "0", "1"]`, so the **unique** good subsequences are `"0"` and `"1"`. Note that subsequences `"00"`, `"01"`, and `"001"` are not good because they have leading zeros.

Return *the number of **unique good subsequences** of `binary`*. Since the answer may be very large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** binary = "001"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The good subsequences of binary are ["0", "0", "1"].

The unique good subsequences are "0" and "1".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** binary = "11"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The good subsequences of binary are ["1", "1", "11"].

The unique good subsequences are "1" and "11".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** binary = "101"

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** The good subsequences of binary are ["1", "0", "1", "10", "11", "101"].

The unique good subsequences are "0", "1", "10", "11", and "101".

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= binary.length <= 10^5`
* `binary` consists of only `'0'`s and `'1'`s.

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create an array `dp` of length `binary.length() + 1`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of unique good subsequences among the first `i` characters of `binary`. Find the first character that is `'1'` in `binary`, which is at index `startIndex`, and set `dp[startIndex + 1] = 1`. Then calculate the values of `dp` starting from `dp[startIndex + 2]` to the end. If there exists character `'0'` in `binary`, add 1 to the answer since a single `'0'` is also a good subsequence. Finally, return the answer.
