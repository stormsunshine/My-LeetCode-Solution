# 1436. Destination City
## Level
Easy

## Description
You are given the array `paths`, where `paths[i] = [cityA_i, cityB_i]` means there exists a direct path going from `cityA_i` to `cityB_i`. *Return the destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing to another city.*

It is guaranteed that the graph of paths forms a line without any loop, therefore, there will be exactly one destination city.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]

**Output:** "Sao Paulo" 

**Explanation:** Starting at "London" city you will reach "Sao Paulo" city which is the destination city. Your trip consist of: "London" -> "New York" -> "Lima" -> "Sao Paulo".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** paths = [["B","C"],["D","B"],["C","A"]]

**Output:** "A"

**Explanation:** All possible trips are:

"D" -> "B" -> "C" -> "A".

"B" -> "C" -> "A".

"C" -> "A".

"A".

Clearly the destination city is "A".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** paths = [["A","Z"]]

**Output:** "Z"

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= paths.length <= 100`
* `paths[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= cityA_i.length, cityB_i.length <= 10`
* `cityA_i != cityB_i`
* All strings consist of lowercase and uppercase English letters and the space character.

## Solution
Use a set to store all the cities that occur as source cities. Then loop over all paths and find a destination city that is not in the set, and return the destination city.
