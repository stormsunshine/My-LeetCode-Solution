# 1819. Number of Different Subsequences GCDs
## Level
Hard

## Description
You are given an array `nums` that consists of positive integers.

The **GCD** of a sequence of numbers is defined as the greatest integer that divides **all** the numbers in the sequence evenly.

* For example, the GCD of the sequence `[4,6,16]` is `2`.

A **subsequence** of an array is a sequence that can be formed by removing some elements (possibly none) of the array.

* For example, `[2,5,10]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,1,2,4,1,5,10]`.

Return *the **number** of **different** GCDs among all **non-empty** subsequences of `nums`*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [6,10,3]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** The figure shows all the non-empty subsequences and their GCDs.

The different GCDs are 6, 10, 3, 2, and 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [5,15,40,5,6]

**Output:** 7

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 2 * 10^5`

## Solution
For each `num` in `nums`, obtain all the factors of `num`. Count the number of each factor from 1 to `max(nums)`. For each `i` such that `1 <= i <= max(nums)`, let `counts[i]` be the number of factor `i` that occurs in `nums`. If `i` is in `nums`, or `counts[i] > 0` and there does not exist any `j` such that `j > i` and `j % i == 0`, then `i` is the GCD of a subsequence of `nums`. Finally, return the number of different subsequences GCDs.
