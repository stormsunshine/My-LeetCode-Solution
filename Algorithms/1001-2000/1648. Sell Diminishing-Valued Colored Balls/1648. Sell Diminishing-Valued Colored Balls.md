# 1648. Sell Diminishing-Valued Colored Balls
## Level
Medium

## Description
You have an `inventory` of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants `orders` balls of **any** color.

The customer weirdly values the colored balls. Each colored ball's value is the number of balls **of that color** you currently have in your `inventory`. For example, if you own `6` yellow balls, the customer would pay `6` for the first yellow ball. After the transaction, there are only `5` yellow balls left, so the next yellow ball is then valued at `5` (i.e., the value of the balls decreases as you sell more to the customer).

You are given an integer array, `inventory`, where `inventory[i]` represents the number of balls of the `i-th` color that you initially own. You are also given an integer `orders`, which represents the total number of balls that the customer wants. You can sell the balls **in any order**.

Return *the **maximum** total value that you can attain after selling `orders` colored balls*. As the answer may be too large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/11/05/jj.gif)

**Input:** inventory = [2,5], orders = 4

**Output:** 14

**Explanation:** Sell the 1st color 1 time (2) and the 2nd color 3 times (5 + 4 + 3).
The maximum total value is 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 = 14.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** inventory = [3,5], orders = 6

**Output:** 19

**Explanation:** Sell the 1st color 2 times (3 + 2) and the 2nd color 4 times (5 + 4 + 3 + 2).

The maximum total value is 3 + 2 + 5 + 4 + 3 + 2 = 19.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** inventory = [2,8,4,10,6], orders = 20

**Output:** 110

**Example 4:**

**Input:** inventory = [1000000000], orders = 1000000000

**Output:** 21

**Explanation:** Sell the 1st color 1000000000 times for a total value of 500000000500000000. 500000000500000000 modulo 109 + 7 = 21.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= inventory.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= inventory[i] <= 10^9`
* `1 <= orders <= min(sum(inventory[i]), 10^9)`

## Solution
Use a greedy approach. Always sell a ball with the maximum numbers remaining. Use a hash map to store the number of balls and how many balls have such a number. Use a priority queue to store the number of balls, where the maximum element is polled first. If there is only one element in the priority queue, then calculate the profit with the remaining `orders`. Otherwise, poll the greatest element from the priority queue and obtain the second greatest element from the priority queue (without polling it) and calculate the profit according to the greatest element and the remaining `orders`.
