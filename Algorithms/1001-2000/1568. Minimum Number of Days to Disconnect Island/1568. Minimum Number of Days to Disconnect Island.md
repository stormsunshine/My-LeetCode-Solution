# 1568. Minimum Number of Days to Disconnect Island
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a 2D `grid` consisting of `1`s (land) and `0`s (water). An *island* is a maximal 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical) connected group of `1`s.

The grid is said to be **connected** if we have **exactly one island**, otherwise is said **disconnected**.

In one day, we are allowed to change **any** single land cell `(1)` into a water cell `(0)`.

Return *the minimum number of days* to disconnect the grid.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0]]
Output: 2
Explanation: We need at least 2 days to get a disconnected grid.
Change land grid[1][1] and grid[0][2] to water and get 2 disconnected island.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Grid of full water is also disconnected ([[1,1]] -> [[0,0]]), 0 islands.
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,0,1,0]]
Output: 0
```
**Example 4:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,1,0,1,1],
               [1,1,1,1,1],
               [1,1,0,1,1],
               [1,1,0,1,1]]
Output: 1
```
**Example 5:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,1,0,1,1],
               [1,1,1,1,1],
               [1,1,0,1,1],
               [1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= grid.length, grid[i].length <= 30`
* `grid[i][j]` is `0` or `1`.

## Solution
If the original `grid` is already disconnected, return 0. Otherwise, the number is at most 2.

Loop over `grid` and count the number of connected components. If there are at least 2 connected components, then return 0. If `grid` is connected and has 2 lands, return 2. Otherwise, try to remove each land and check whether this operation can make `grid` disconnected. If such a land exists, return 1. Otherwise, return 2.
