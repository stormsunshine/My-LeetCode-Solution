# 1483. Kth Ancestor of a Tree Node
## Level
Hard

## Description
You are given a tree with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1` in the form of a parent array where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`. The root of the tree is node `0`.

Implement the function `getKthAncestor(int node, int k)` to return the `k`-th ancestor of the given `node`. If there is no such ancestor, return `-1`.

The *k-th ancestor* of a tree node is the `k`-th node in the path from that node to the root.

**Example:**

```
Input:
["TreeAncestor","getKthAncestor","getKthAncestor","getKthAncestor"]
[[7,[-1,0,0,1,1,2,2]],[3,1],[5,2],[6,3]]

Output:
[null,1,0,-1]

Explanation:
TreeAncestor treeAncestor = new TreeAncestor(7, [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]);

treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(3, 1);  // returns 1 which is the parent of 3
treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(5, 2);  // returns 0 which is the grandparent of 5
treeAncestor.getKthAncestor(6, 3);  // returns -1 because there is no such ancestor
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= k <= n <= 5*10^4`
* `parent[0] == -1` indicating that `0` is the root node.
* `0 <= parent[i] < n` for all `0 < i < n`
* `0 <= node < n`
* There will be at most `5*10^4` queries.

## Solution
One naive approach is to directly store each node's all ancestors, from its direct parent to the root. However, this is quite time-consuming and will lead to time limit exceed.

Another approach is to store each node's 2^n-th ancestors, where n = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, etc. In this way, to find a node's `k`-th ancestor, find the maximum integer `p` such that `2^p < k`, find the `2^p`-th ancestor of the node, and then find the `k - 2^p`-th ancestor of the ancestor. In this way, both the constructor and method `getKthAncestor` will have O(log n) time complexity.
