# 1782. Count Pairs Of Nodes
## Level
Hard

## Description
You are given an undirected graph represented by an integer `n`, which is the number of nodes, and `edges`, where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` which indicates that there is an undirected edge between `u_i` and `v_i`. You are also given an integer array `queries`.

The answer to the `j-th` query is the number of pairs of nodes `(a, b)` that satisfy the following conditions:

* `a < b`
* `cnt` is **strictly greater** than `queries[j]`, where `cnt` is the number of edges incident to `a` **or** `b`.

Return an array `answers` such that `answers.length == queries.length` and `answers[j]` is the answer of the `j-th` query.

Note that there can be **repeated edges**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[1,2],[2,4],[1,3],[2,3],[2,1]], queries = [2,3]

**Output:** [6,5]

**Explanation:** The number of edges incident to at least one of each pair is shown above.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5, edges = [[1,5],[1,5],[3,4],[2,5],[1,3],[5,1],[2,3],[2,5]], queries = [1,2,3,4,5]

**Output:** [10,10,9,8,6]

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
* `1 <= edges.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= u_i, v_i <= n`
* `u_i != v_i`
* `1 <= queries.length <= 20`
* `0 <= queries[j] < edges.length`

## Solution
First, calculate the degrees of each node and the counts of each edge. Next, use another array `arr` to store the degrees and sort `arr`. Then, for each query, use two pointers to calculate the number of pairs of nodes that satisfy the conditions. Finally, return the query result.
