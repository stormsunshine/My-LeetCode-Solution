# 1755. Closest Subsequence Sum
## Level
Hard

## Description
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `goal`.

You want to choose a subsequence of `nums` such that the sum of its elements is the closest possible to `goal`. That is, if the sum of the subsequence's elements is `sum`, then you want to **minimize the absolute difference** `abs(sum - goal)`.

Return *the **minimum** possible value of `abs(sum - goal)`*.

Note that a subsequence of an array is an array formed by removing some elements **(possibly all or none)** of the original array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [5,-7,3,5], goal = 6

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** Choose the whole array as a subsequence, with a sum of 6.
This is equal to the goal, so the absolute difference is 0.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [7,-9,15,-2], goal = -5

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** Choose the subsequence [7,-9,-2], with a sum of -4.

The absolute difference is abs(-4 - (-5)) = abs(1) = 1, which is the minimum.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3], goal = -7

**Output:** 7

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 40`
* `-10^7 <= nums[i] <= 10^7`
* `-10^9 <= goal <= 10^9`

## Solution
Divide `nums` of two parts that have lengths differ by at most 1. For each part, calculate all subsets' sums of elements, and use a list to store the sums of all subsets. After the two lists are obtained, sort the two lists and find the closest sum of two elements from the two list (one from each list). Use two pointers to do this. After the closest sum is found, calculate the minimum absolute difference.
