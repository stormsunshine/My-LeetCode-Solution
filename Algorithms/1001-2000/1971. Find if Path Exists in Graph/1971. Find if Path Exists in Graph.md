# 1971. Find if Path Exists in Graph
## Level
Easy

## Description
There is a **bi-directional** graph with `n` vertices, where each vertex is labeled from `0` to `n - 1` (**inclusive**). The edges in the graph are represented as a 2D integer array edges, where each `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` denotes a bi-directional edge between vertex `u_i` and vertex `v_i`. Every vertex pair is connected by **at most one** edge, and no vertex has an edge to itself.

You want to determine if there is a **valid path** that exists from vertex `start` to vertex `end`.

Given `edges` and the integers `n`, `start`, and `end`, return *`true` if there is a **valid path** from `start` to `end`, or `false` otherwise*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0]], start = 0, end = 2

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** There are two paths from vertex 0 to vertex 2:
- 0 → 1 → 2
- 0 → 2

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/14/validpath-ex2.png)

**Input:** n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[3,5],[5,4],[4,3]], start = 0, end = 5

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** There is no path from vertex 0 to vertex 5.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5`
* `0 <= edges.length <= 2 * 10^5`
* `edges[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= u_i, v_i <= n - 1`
* `u_i != v_i`
* `1 <= start, end <= n - 1`
* There are no duplicate edges.
* There are no self edges.

## Solution
Use hash map to store each vertex's adjacent vertices. Then do breadth first search starting from vertex `start`. If `end` can be reached, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.
