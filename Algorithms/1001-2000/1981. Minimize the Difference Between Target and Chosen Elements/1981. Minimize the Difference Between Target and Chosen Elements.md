# 1981. Minimize the Difference Between Target and Chosen Elements
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `mat` and an integer `target`.

Choose one integer from **each row** in the matrix such that the **absolute difference** between `target` and the **sum** of the chosen elements is **minimized**.

Return *the **minimum absolute difference***.

The **absolute difference** between two numbers `a` and `b` is the absolute value of `a - b`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], target = 13

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:8* One possible choice is to:
- Choose 1 from the first row.
- Choose 5 from the second row.
- Choose 7 from the third row.

The sum of the chosen elements is 13, which equals the target, so the absolute difference is 0.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** mat = [[1],[2],[3]], target = 100

**Output:** 94

**Explanation:** The best possible choice is to:
- Choose 1 from the first row.
- Choose 2 from the second row.
- Choose 3 from the third row.

The sum of the chosen elements is 6, and the absolute difference is 94.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** mat = [[1,2,9,8,7]], target = 6

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** The best choice is to choose 7 from the first row.

The absolute difference is 1.

**Constraints:**

* `m == mat.length`
* `n == mat[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 70`
* `1 <= mat[i][j] <= 70`
* `1 <= target <= 800`

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `dp` with `m + 1` rows and 4901 columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents whether sum `j` is reachable by using the first `i` rows of `mat`. Loop over `mat` to fill in the values in `dp`. Finally, loop over the last row of `dp` and find the value `j` such that `dp[m][j] = true` and `j` is closest to `target`. Return the absolute difference between `j` and `target`.
