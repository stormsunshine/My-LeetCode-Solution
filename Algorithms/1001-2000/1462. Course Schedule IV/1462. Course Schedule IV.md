# 1462. Course Schedule IV
## Level
Medium

## Description
There are a total of `n` courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.

Some courses may have direct prerequisites, for example, to take course 0 you have first to take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[1,0]`

Given the total number of courses `n`, a list of direct `prerequisite` **pairs** and a list of `queries` **pairs**.

You should answer for each `queries[i]` whether the course `queries[i][0]` is a prerequisite of the course `queries[i][1]` or not.

Return *a list of boolean*, the answers to the given `queries`.

Please note that if course **a** is a prerequisite of course **b** and course **b** is a prerequisite of course **c**, then, course **a** is a prerequisite of course **c**.

**Example 1:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/17/graph.png)

**Input:** n = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]], queries = [[0,1],[1,0]]

**Output:** [false,true]

**Explanation:** course 0 is not a prerequisite of course 1 but the opposite is true.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 2, prerequisites = [], queries = [[1,0],[0,1]]

**Output:** [false,false]

**Explanation:** There are no prerequisites and each course is independent.

**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/04/17/graph-1.png)

**Input:** n = 3, prerequisites = [[1,2],[1,0],[2,0]], queries = [[1,0],[1,2]]

**Output:** [true,true]

**Example 4:**

**Input:** n = 3, prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0]], queries = [[0,1],[2,0]]

**Output:** [false,true]

**Example 5:**

**Input:** n = 5, prerequisites = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]], queries = [[0,4],[4,0],[1,3],[3,0]]

**Output:** [true,false,true,false]

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 100`
* `0 <= prerequisite.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)`
* `0 <= prerequisite[i][0], prerequisite[i][1] < n`
* `prerequisite[i][0] != prerequisite[i][1]`
* The prerequisites graph has no cycles.
* The prerequisites graph has no repeated edges.
* `1 <= queries.length <= 10^4`
* `queries[i][0] != queries[i][1]`

## Solution
Use a map to store each course and the courses after the course. Then do the queries according to the map.

Use a query map to store the results of queries as well. For each query, first check whether the query map contains the query courses. If so, return the result directly. Otherwise, do depth first search and update the query map along the way. Finally, return the list of query results.
