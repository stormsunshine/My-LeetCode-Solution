# 1992. Find All Groups of Farmland
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** `m x n` binary matrix `land` where a `0` represents a hectare of forested land and a `1` represents a hectare of farmland.

To keep the land organized, there are designated rectangular areas of hectares that consist **entirely** of farmland. These rectangular areas are called **groups**. No two groups are adjacent, meaning farmland in one group is **not** four-directionally adjacent to another farmland in a different group.

`land` can be represented by a coordinate system where the top left corner of `land` is `(0, 0)` and the bottom right corner of `land` is `(m-1, n-1)`. Find the coordinates of the top left and bottom right corner of each group of farmland. A group of farmland with a top left corner at `(r1, c1)` and a bottom right corner at `(r2, c2)` is represented by the 4-length array `[r1, c1, r2, c2]`.

Return *a 2D array containing the 4-length arrays described above for each **group** of farmland in `land`. If there are no groups of farmland, return an empty array. You may return the answer in **any order***.

**Input:** land = [[1,0,0],[0,1,1],[0,1,1]]

**Output:** [[0,0,0,0],[1,1,2,2]]

**Explanation:**

The first group has a top left corner at land[0][0] and a bottom right corner at land[0][0].

The second group has a top left corner at land[1][1] and a bottom right corner at land[2][2].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** land = [[1,1],[1,1]]

**Output:** [[0,0,1,1]]

**Explanation:**

The first group has a top left corner at land[0][0] and a bottom right corner at land[1][1].

**Input:** land = [[0]]

**Output:** []

**Explanation:**

There are no groups of farmland.

**Constraints:**

* `m == land.length`
* `n == land[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 300`
* `land` consists of only `0`'s and `1`'s.
* Groups of farmland are **rectangular** in shape.

## Solution
For each farmland, do breadth first search and return the top left corner and the bottom right corner of the farmland. Each farmland will be visited exactly once. Return the corners of the farmlands.
