# 1903. Largest Odd Number in String
## Level
Easy

## Description
You are given a string `num`, representing a large integer. Return *the **largest-valued odd** integer (as a string) that is a **non-empty substring** of `num`, or an empty string `""` if no odd integer exists*.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = "52"

**Output:** "5"

**Explanation:** The only non-empty substrings are "5", "2", and "52". "5" is the only odd number.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = "4206"

**Output:** ""

**Explanation:** There are no odd numbers in "4206".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** num = "35427"

**Output:** "35427"

**Explanation:** "35427" is already an odd number.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= num.length <= 10^5`
* `num` only consists of digits and does not contain any leading zeros.

## Solution
Any number that ends with an odd digit is an odd number. If a digit in `num` is an odd number, then the substring from index 0 to the current digit is ghe largest odd number that ends with the digit. Therefore, find the rightmost odd digit in `nums`, and return the substring from index 0 to the rightmost odd digit.
