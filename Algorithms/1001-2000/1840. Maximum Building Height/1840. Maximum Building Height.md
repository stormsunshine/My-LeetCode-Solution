# 1840. Maximum Building Height
## Level
Hard

## Description
You want to build `n` new buildings in a city. The new buildings will be built in a line and are labeled from `1` to `n`.

However, there are city restrictions on the heights of the new buildings:

* The height of each building must be a non-negative integer.
* The height of the first building **must** be `0`.
* The height difference between any two adjacent buildings **cannot exceed** `1`.

Additionally, there are city restrictions on the maximum height of specific buildings. These restrictions are given as a 2D integer array `restrictions` where `restrictions[i] = [id_i, maxHeight_i]` indicates that building `id_i` must have a height less than or equal to `maxHeight_i`.

It is guaranteed that each building will appear **at most once** in `restrictions`, and building `1` will **not** be in `restrictions`.

Return *the **maximum possible height** of the **tallest** building*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 5, restrictions = [[2,1],[4,1]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.

We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,1,2], and the tallest building has a height of 2.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/ic236-q4-ex2.png)

**Input:** n = 6, restrictions = []

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.

We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,3,4,5], and the tallest building has a height of 5.

**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/04/08/ic236-q4-ex3.png)

**Input:** n = 10, restrictions = [[5,3],[2,5],[7,4],[10,3]]

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:** The green area in the image indicates the maximum allowed height for each building.

We can build the buildings with heights [0,1,2,3,3,4,4,5,4,3], and the tallest building has a height of 5.

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= n <= 10^9`
* `0 <= restrictions.length <= min(n - 1, 10^5)`
* `2 <= id_i <= n`
* `id_i` is unique.
* `0 <= maxHeight_i <= 10^9`

## Solution
Sort `restrictions` according to the `id` values. Then loop over `restrictions` forward and backward to determine the actual maximum possible height of each element in `restrictions`. Next, for two adjacent restrictions `[i, a]` and `[j, b]` where `i < j`, the maximum possible height in the ranges `[i, j]` is `(j - i + Math.abs(b - a)) / 2 + Math.min(a, b)`. The last thing is to calculate the maximum possible height of the building with `id = n`. Finally, return the maximum possible height among all `n` buildings.
