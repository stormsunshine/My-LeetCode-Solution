# 1785. Minimum Elements to Add to Form a Given Sum
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `limit` and `goal`. The array nums has an interesting property that `abs(nums[i]) <= limit`.

Return *the minimum number of elements you need to add to make the sum of the array equal to `goal`*. The array must maintain its property that `abs(nums[i]) <= limit`.

Note that `abs(x)` equals `x` if `x >= 0`, and `-x` otherwise.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,-1,1], limit = 3, goal = -4

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** You can add -2 and -3, then the sum of the array will be 1 - 1 + 1 - 2 - 3 = -4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,-10,9,1], limit = 100, goal = 0

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= limit <= 10^6`
* `-limit <= nums[i] <= limit`
* `-10^9 <= goal <= 10^9`

## Solution
First, calculate `sum` as the sum of all elements in `nums`. Next, calculate the absolute difference between `goal` and `sum`, and calculate the minimum number of elements to add using a greedy approach, which means consider adding `limit` or `-limit` as many as possible and adding one more element if the remaining absolute difference is less than `limit`.
