# 1959. Minimum Total Space Wasted With K Resizing Operations
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are currently designing a dynamic array. You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` is the number of elements that will be in the array at time `i`. In addition, you are given an integer `k`, the **maximum** number of times you can **resize** the array (to **any** size).

The size of the array at time `t`, `size_t`, must be at least `nums[t]` because there needs to be enough space in the array to hold all the elements. The **space wasted** at time `t` is defined as `size_t - nums[t]`, and the **total** space wasted is the **sum** of the space wasted across every time `t` where `0 <= t < nums.length`.

Return *the **minimum total space wasted** if you can resize the array at most `k` times*.

**Note:** The array can have **any size** at the start and does **not** count towards the number of resizing operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [10,20], k = 0

**Output:** 10

**Explanation:** size = [20,20].

We can set the initial size to be 20.

The total wasted space is (20 - 10) + (20 - 20) = 10.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [10,20,30], k = 1

**Output:** 10

**Explanation:** size = [20,20,30].

We can set the initial size to be 20 and resize to 30 at time 2. 

The total wasted space is (20 - 10) + (20 - 20) + (30 - 30) = 10.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [10,20,15,30,20], k = 2

**Output:** 15

**Explanation:** size = [10,20,20,30,30].

We can set the initial size to 10, resize to 20 at time 1, and resize to 30 at time 3.
The total wasted space is (10 - 10) + (20 - 20) + (20 - 15) + (30 - 30) + (30 - 20) = 15.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
* `0 <= k <= nums.length - 1`

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `dp` with `k + 1` rows and `nums.length` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum space wasted with at most `j` resizings. For each `dp[i][j]`, the initial value is infinity. Loop over `l` from `j` to `i` backwards. For each `l`, calculate the `sum` of `nums[i..j]` and the `maxSize` of `nums[i..j]`. If `i > 0 || l == 0`, calculate `dp[i][j]` as the minimum of `dp[i - 1][l - 1] + (maxSize * (j - l + 1) - sum)`, where `dp[i - 1][l - 1] = 0` for `l == 0`. Finally, return `dp[k][nums.length - 1]`.
