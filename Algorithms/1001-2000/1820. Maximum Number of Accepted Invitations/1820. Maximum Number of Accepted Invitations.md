## Level
Medium

## Description
There are `m` boys and `n` girls in a class attending an upcoming party.

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, where `grid[i][j]` equals `0` or `1`. If `grid[i][j] == 1`, then that means the `i-th` boy can invite the `j-th` girl to the party. A boy can invite at most **one girl**, and a girl can accept at most **one invitation** from a boy.

Return *the **maximum** possible number of accepted invitations*.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1],
               [1,0,1],
               [0,0,1]]

Output: 3

Explanation: The invitations are sent as follows:
- The 1st boy invites the 2nd girl.
- The 2nd boy invites the 1st girl.
- The 3rd boy invites the 3rd girl.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,0,1,0],
               [1,0,0,0],
               [0,0,1,0],
               [1,1,1,0]]

Output: 3

Explanation: The invitations are sent as follows:
- The 1st boy invites the 3rd girl.
- The 2nd boy invites the 1st girl.
- The 3rd boy invites no one.
- The 4th boy invites the 2nd girl.
```

**Constraints:**

* `grid.length == m`
* `grid[i].length == n`
* `1 <= m, n <= 200`
* `grid[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Solution
Use backtrack. For each boy, find a girl that matches the boy, and the number of accepted invitations is added by 1 if such a match is found. Finally, return the maximum number of accepted invitations.
