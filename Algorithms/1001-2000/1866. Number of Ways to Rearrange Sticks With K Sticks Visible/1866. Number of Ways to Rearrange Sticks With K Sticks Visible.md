# 1866. Number of Ways to Rearrange Sticks With K Sticks Visible
## Level
Hard

## Description
There are `n` uniquely-sized sticks whose lengths are integers from `1` to `n`. You want to arrange the sticks such that **exactly** `k` sticks are **visible** from the left. A stick is **visible** from the left if there are no **longer** sticks to the **left** of it.

* For example, if the sticks are arranged `[1,3,2,5,4]`, then the sticks with lengths `1`, `3`, and `5` are visible from the left.

Given `n` and `k`, return *the **number** of such arrangements*. Since the answer may be large, return it **modulo** `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, k = 2

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** [1,3,2], [2,3,1], and [2,1,3] are the only arrangements such that exactly 2 sticks are visible.

The visible sticks are underlined.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 5, k = 5

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** [1,2,3,4,5] is the only arrangement such that all 5 sticks are visible.
The visible sticks are underlined.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 20, k = 11

**Output:** 647427950

**Explanation:** There are 647427950 (mod 109 + 7) ways to rearrange the sticks such that exactly 11 sticks are visible.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 1000`
* `1 <= k <= n`

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `dp` with `n + 1` rows and `n + 1` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to rearrange `i` sticks with `j` sticks visible, where `i >= j >= 1`.

The base case of `dp` is that `dp[i][i] = 1` for all `1 <= i <= n`. For the rest values, `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j] * (i - 1)`.

Finally, return `dp[n][k]`.
