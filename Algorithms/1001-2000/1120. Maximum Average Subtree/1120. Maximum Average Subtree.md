# 1120. Maximum Average Subtree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, find the maximum average value of any subtree of that tree.

(A subtree of a tree is any node of that tree plus all its descendants. The average value of a tree is the sum of its values, divided by the number of nodes.)

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [5,6,1]

**Output:** 6.00000

**Explanation:**

For the node with value = 5 we have an average of (5 + 6 + 1) / 3 = 4.

For the node with value = 6 we have an average of 6 / 1 = 6.

For the node with value = 1 we have an average of 1 / 1 = 1.

So the answer is 6 which is the maximum.

**Note:**

1. The number of nodes in the tree is between `1` and `5000`.
2. Each node will have a value between `0` and `100000`.
3. Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within `10^-5` of the correct answer.

## Solution
For each node, create a corresponding node which has value representing the number of nodes in the subtree. Initially, all such nodes have value 1.

Do breadth first search on the tree, and use two lists to store the original nodes and the newly created count nodes. Then loop over both lists in reversing order. For each node, add its children's values and counts to the original node and the count node, respectively. After the original node's value and the count node's value are updated, calculate the average value of the subtree, and update the maximum average value of any subtree.

Finally, return the maximum average value.
