# 1490. Clone N-ary Tree
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a `root` of an N-ary tree, return a **[deep copy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy)** (clone) of the tree.

Each node in the n-ary tree contains a val (`int`) and a list (`List[Node]`) of its children.
```
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> children;
}
```
*Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).*

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]

**Output:** [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/08/sample_4_964.png)

**Input:** root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]

**Output:** [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]

**Constraints:**

* The depth of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`.
* The total number of nodes is between `[0, 10^4]`.

## Solution
Use recursion to do the cloning. If `root` is `null`, then return `null`. Otherwise, clone a new root from `root`, and do the cloning for each child of `root` and assign the cloned children to the new root. Finally, return the new root.
