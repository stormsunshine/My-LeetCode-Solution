# 1779. Find Nearest Point That Has the Same X or Y Coordinate
## Level
Easy

## Description
You are given two integers, `x` and `y`, which represent your current location on a Cartesian grid: `(x, y)`. You are also given an array `points` where each `points[i] = [a_i, b_i]` represents that a point exists at `(a_i, b_i)`. A point is **valid** if it shares the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate as your location.

Return *the index **(0-indexed)** of the **valid** point with the smallest **Manhattan distance** from your current location*. If there are multiple, return *the valid point with the **smallest** index*. If there are no valid points, return `-1`.

The **Manhattan distance** between two points `(x_1, y_1)` and `(x_2, y_2)` is `abs(x_1 - x_2) + abs(y_1 - y_2)`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** x = 3, y = 4, points = [[1,2],[3,1],[2,4],[2,3],[4,4]]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** Of all the points, only [3,1], [2,4] and [4,4] are valid. Of the valid points, [2,4] and [4,4] have the smallest Manhattan distance from your current location, with a distance of 1. [2,4] has the smallest index, so return 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = 3, y = 4, points = [[3,4]]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** The answer is allowed to be on the same location as your current location.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** x = 3, y = 4, points = [[2,3]]

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:** There are no valid points.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= points.length <= 10^4`
* `points[i].length == 2`
* `1 <= x, y, a_i, b_i <= 10^4`

## Solution
Loop over all points in `points`. For each point, if it is valid, calculate the Manhattan distance from `(x, y)` and update the smallest distance and the index if the current distance is smaller. Finally, return the index (or -1 if no point is valid).
