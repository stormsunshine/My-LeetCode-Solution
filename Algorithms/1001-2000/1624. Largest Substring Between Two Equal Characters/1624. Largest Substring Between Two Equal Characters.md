# 1624. Largest Substring Between Two Equal Characters
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a string `s`, return *the length of the longest substring between two equal characters, excluding the two characters*. If there is no such substring return `-1`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "aa"

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** The optimal substring here is an empty substring between the two 'a's.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "abca"

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** The optimal substring here is "bc".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "cbzxy"

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:** There are no characters that appear twice in s.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s = "cabbac"

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The optimal substring here is "abba". Other non-optimal substrings include "bb" and "".

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 300`
* `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

## Solution
Use a map to store each character's first occurrence index. Loop over `s`. For each character, if it is not in the map, store it in the map with the current index. Otherwise, calculate the length and update the maximum length accordingly. Finally, return the maximum length.
