# 1902. Depth of BST Given Insertion Order
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `order` of length `n`, a **permutation** of integers from `1` to `n` representing the **order** of insertion into a **binary search tree**.

A binary search tree is defined as follows:

* The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **less than** the node's key.
* The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys **greater than** the node's key.
* Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

The binary search tree is constructed as follows:

* `order[0]` will be the **root** of the binary search tree.
* All subsequent elements are inserted as the **child** of **any** existing node such that the binary search tree properties hold.

Return *the **depth** of the binary search tree*.

A binary tree's **depth8* is the number of **nodes** along the **longest path** from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** order = [2,1,4,3]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The binary search tree has a depth of 3 with path 2->3->4.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** order = [2,1,3,4]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The binary search tree has a depth of 3 with path 2->3->4.

**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/06/15/3.png)

**Input:** order = [1,2,3,4]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The binary search tree has a depth of 4 with path 1->2->3->4.

**Constraints:**

* `n == order.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `order` is a permutation of integers between `1` and `n`.

## Solution
Use a TreeMap to store each value's depth. Initially, value `order[0]` has depth 1.

Loop over the remaining elements in `order`. For each value `curr`, find the two adjacent values of `curr` in the TreeMap, which are `prev` and `next` such that `prev <= curr <= next`. If both values exist (not `null`), then since both `prev` and `next` come before `curr`, the depth of `curr` is the maximum of the depths of `prev` and `next` plus 1. If only one value exists, then the depth of `curr` is the depth of the existing value plus 1.

Maintain the maximum depth during the process. Finally, return the maximum depth.
