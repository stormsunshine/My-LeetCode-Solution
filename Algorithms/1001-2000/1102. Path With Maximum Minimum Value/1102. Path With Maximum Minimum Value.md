# 1102. Path With Maximum Minimum Value
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a matrix of integers `A` with R rows and C columns, find the **maximum** score of a path starting at `[0,0]` and ending at `[R-1,C-1]`.

The *score* of a path is the **minimum** value in that path. For example, the value of the path 8 → 4 → 5 → 9 is 4.

A *path* moves some number of times from one visited cell to any neighbouring unvisited cell in one of the 4 cardinal directions (north, east, west, south).

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [[5,4,5],[1,2,6],[7,4,6]]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The path with the maximum score is highlighted in yellow. 

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [[2,2,1,2,2,2],[1,2,2,2,1,2]]

**Output:** 2

**Example 3:**

**Input:** [[3,4,6,3,4],[0,2,1,1,7],[8,8,3,2,7],[3,2,4,9,8],[4,1,2,0,0],[4,6,5,4,3]]

**Output:** 3

**Note:**

1. `1 <= R, C <= 100`
2. `0 <= A[i][j] <= 10^9`

## Solution
For each cell in the matrix, store its row, column and score in the path, where score in the path is the minimum value in the path. Use a priority queue to store the cells, where the cell with the maximum score is polled first. Each time poll a cell from the priority queue, and update its adjacent cells' scores. Make sure that each cell is visited only once. Since a priority queue is used, it is guaranteed that each cell's score is the maximum possible score. Finally, return the score at the bottom right corner.
