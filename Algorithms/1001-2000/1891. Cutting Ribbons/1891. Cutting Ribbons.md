# 1891. Cutting Ribbons
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given an integer array `ribbons`, where `ribbons[i]` represents the length of the `i-th` ribbon, and an integer `k`. You may cut any of the ribbons into any number of segments of **positive integer** lengths, or perform no cuts at all.

* For example, if you have a ribbon of length `4`, you can:
   * Keep the ribbon of length `4`,
   * Cut it into one ribbon of length `3` and one ribbon of length `1`,
   * Cut it into two ribbons of length `2`,
   * Cut it into one ribbon of length `2` and two ribbons of length `1`, or
   * Cut it into four ribbons of length `1`.

Your goal is to obtain `k` ribbons of all the **same positive integer length**. You are allowed to throw away any excess ribbon as a result of cutting.

Return *the **maximum** possible positive integer length that you can obtain `k` ribbons of, or `0` if you cannot obtain `k` ribbons of the same length*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ribbons = [9,7,5], k = 3

**Output:** 5

**Explanation:**
- Cut the first ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 5 and one of length 4.
- Cut the second ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 5 and one of length 2.
- Keep the third ribbon as it is.

Now you have 3 ribbons of length 5.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** ribbons = [7,5,9], k = 4

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:**
- Cut the first ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 4 and one of length 3.
- Cut the second ribbon to two ribbons, one of length 4 and one of length 1.
- Cut the third ribbon to three ribbons, two of length 4 and one of length 1.

Now you have 4 ribbons of length 4.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** ribbons = [5,7,9], k = 22

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** You cannot obtain k ribbons of the same positive integer length.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= ribbons.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= ribbons[i] <= 10^5`
* `1 <= k <= 10^9`

## Solution
Use binary search. Initialize `low` as `0` and `high` as the maximum in `ribbons`. Each time let `mid = (high - low + 1) / 2 + low` and calculate the number of ribbons that can be obtained with length `mid`. If the number of ribbons is greater than or equal to `k`, then the length is at least `mid`, so let `low = mid`. Otherwise, the length is at most `mid - 1`, so let `high = mid - 1`. Finally, return `low` as the maximum possible length.
