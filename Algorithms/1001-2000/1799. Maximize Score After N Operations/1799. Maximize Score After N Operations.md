# 1799. Maximize Score After N Operations
## Level
Hard

## Description
You are given `nums`, an array of positive integers of size `2 * n`. You must perform `n` operations on this array.

In the `i-th` operation **(1-indexed)**, you will:

* Choose two elements, `x` and `y`.
* Receive a score of `i * gcd(x, y)`.
* Remove `x` and `y` from `nums`.

Return *the maximum score you can receive after performing `n` operations*.

The function `gcd(x, y)` is the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2]

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** The optimal choice of operations is:

(1 * gcd(1, 2)) = 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,4,6,8]

**Output:** 11

**Explanation:** The optimal choice of operations is:

(1 * gcd(3, 6)) + (2 * gcd(4, 8)) = 3 + 8 = 11

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6]

**Output:** 14

**Explanation:** The optimal choice of operations is:

(1 * gcd(1, 5)) + (2 * gcd(2, 4)) + (3 * gcd(3, 6)) = 1 + 4 + 9 = 14

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n <= 7`
* `nums.length == 2 * n`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`

## Solution
In this problem, the `2 * n` numbers in `nums` need to be divided into `n` groups, where each group contains 2 numbers. Find all possible combinations, and for each combination, calculate the score accordingly. Finally, return the maximum score.
