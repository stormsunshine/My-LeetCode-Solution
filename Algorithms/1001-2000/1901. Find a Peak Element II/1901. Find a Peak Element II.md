# 1901. Find a Peak Element II
## Level
Medium

## Description
A **peak** element in a 2D grid is an element that is **strictly greater** than all of its **adjacent** neighbors to the left, right, top, and bottom.

Given a **0-indexed** `m x n` matrix `mat` where **no two adjacent cells are equal**, find **any** peak element `mat[i][j]` and return *the length 2 array* `[i,j]`.

You may assume that the entire matrix is surrounded by an **outer perimeter** with the value -1 in each cell.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(m log(n))` or `O(n log(m))` time.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** mat = [[1,4],[3,2]]

**Output:** [0,1]

**Explanation:** Both 3 and 4 are peak elements so [1,0] and [0,1] are both acceptable answers.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** mat = [[10,20,15],[21,30,14],[7,16,32]]

**Output:** [1,1]

**Explanation:** Both 30 and 32 are peak elements so [1,1] and [2,2] are both acceptable answers.

**Constraints:**

* `m == mat.length`
* `n == mat[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 500`
* `1 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^5`
* No two adjacent cells are equal.

## Solution
Use binary search. Initialize `low = 0` and `high = m - 1`. Each time let `mid` be the mean of `low` and `high`, and find `maxIndex` such that `mat[mid][maxIndex]` is the greatest element in the row `mat[mid]`. If `mat[mid][maxIndex] < mat[mid + 1][maxIndex]`, then let `low = mid + 1`. Otherwise, let `high = mid`.

When the row is determined using binary search, find the greatest element in the row and get the column index of the greatest element. Return the row index and the column index.
