# 1838. Frequency of the Most Frequent Element
## Level
Medium

## Description
The **frequency** of an element is the number of times it occurs in an array.

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can choose an index of `nums` and increment the element at that index by `1`.

Return *the **maximum possible frequency** of an element after performing **at most** `k` operations*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,2,4], k = 5

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** Increment the first element three times and the second element two times to make nums = [4,4,4].

4 has a frequency of 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1,4,8,13], k = 5

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** There are multiple optimal solutions:
- Increment the first element three times to make nums = [4,4,8,13]. 4 has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the second element four times to make nums = [1,8,8,13]. 8 has a frequency of 2.
- Increment the third element five times to make nums = [1,4,13,13]. 13 has a frequency of 2.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [3,9,6], k = 2

**Output:** 1

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
* `1 <= k <= 10^5`

## Solution
Sort the array `nums`. Calculate a new array `differences` as the differences of adjacent elements in `nums`, and calculate the prefix sums of `differences`. Then use binary search to find the maximum frequency of the most frequent element.
