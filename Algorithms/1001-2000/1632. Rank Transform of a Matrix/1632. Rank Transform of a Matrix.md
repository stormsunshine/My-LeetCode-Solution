# 1632. Rank Transform of a Matrix
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given an `m x n` `matrix`, return *a new matrix answer where `answer[row][col]` is the **rank** of `matrix[row][col]`*.

The **rank** is an **integer** that represents how large an element is compared to other elements. It is calculated using the following rules:

* If an element is the smallest element in its row and column, then its **rank** is 1.
* If two elements `p` and `q` are in the **same row or column**, then:
   * If `p < q` then `rank(p) < rank(q)`
   * If `p == q` then `rank(p) == rank(q)`
   * If `p > q` then `rank(p) > rank(q)`
* The **rank** should be as **small** as possible.

It is guaranteed that answer is unique under the given rules.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** matrix = [[1,2],[3,4]]

**Output:** [[1,2],[2,3]]

**Explanation:**

The rank of matrix[0][0] is 1 because it is the smallest integer in its row and column.

The rank of matrix[0][1] is 2 because matrix[0][1] > matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][0] is rank 1.

The rank of matrix[1][0] is 2 because matrix[1][0] > matrix[0][0] and matrix[0][0] is rank 1.

The rank of matrix[1][1] is 3 because matrix[1][1] > matrix[0][1], matrix[1][1] > matrix[1][0], and both matrix[0][1] and matrix[1][0] are rank 2.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** matrix = [[7,7],[7,7]]

**Output:** [[1,1],[1,1]]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** matrix = [[20,-21,14],[-19,4,19],[22,-47,24],[-19,4,19]]

**Output:** [[4,2,3],[1,3,4],[5,1,6],[1,3,4]]

**Example 4:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/18/rank4.jpg)

**Input:** matrix = [[7,3,6],[1,4,5],[9,8,2]]

**Output:** [[5,1,4],[1,2,3],[6,3,1]]

**Constraints:**

* `m == matrix.length`
* `n == matrix[i].length`
* `1 <= m, n <= 500`
* `-10^9 <= matrix[row][col] <= 10^9`

## Solution
Use union find. For each element in `matrix`, store its parent and rank information. Initially, for th `i`-th element, its parent is `i`, where `0 <= i < m * n`. Sort the elements in ascending order. For each element, obtain the row index and the column index that were the last indices updated, and obtain the ranks. If the current element's value equals the previous element's value, then do union to the union find and make the rank the same value. Otherwise, set the rank of the current element to be the previous element's rank plus 1. Finally, convert the ranks to a 2D matrix and return.
