# 1492. The kth Factor of n
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given two positive integers `n` and `k`.

A factor of an integer `n` is defined as an integer `i` where `n % i == 0`.

Consider a list of all factors of `n` sorted in **ascending order**, return *the `kth` factor* in this list or return **-1** if `n` has less than `k` factors.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 12, k = 3

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** Factors list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12], the 3rd factor is 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = 7, k = 2

**Output:** 7

**Explanation:** Factors list is [1, 7], the 2nd factor is 7.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** n = 4, k = 4

**Output:** -1

**Explanation:** Factors list is [1, 2, 4], there is only 3 factors. We should return -1.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** n = 1, k = 1

**Output:** 1

**Explanation:** Factors list is [1], the 1st factor is 1.

**Example 5:**

**Input:** n = 1000, k = 3

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** Factors list is [1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10, 20, 25, 40, 50, 100, 125, 200, 250, 500, 1000].

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= k <= n <= 1000`

## Solution
Use a list to store all the factors of `n` from 1 to the square root of `n`. If `k` does not exceed the size of the list, then simply obtain the factor and return. Otherwise, find the factor `i` according to the given `k`, and return `n / i`.
