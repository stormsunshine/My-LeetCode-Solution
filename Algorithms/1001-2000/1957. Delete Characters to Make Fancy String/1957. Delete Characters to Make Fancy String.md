# 1957. Delete Characters to Make Fancy String
## Level
Easy

## Description
A **fancy string** is a string where no **three consecutive** characters are equal.

Given a string `s`, delete the **minimum** possible number of characters from `s` to make it **fancy**.

Return *the final string after the deletion*. It can be shown that the answer will always be **unique**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "leeetcode"

**Output:** "leetcode"

**Explanation:**

Remove an 'e' from the first group of 'e's to create "leetcode".

No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "leetcode".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "aaabaaaa"

**Output:** "aabaa"

**Explanation:**

Remove an 'a' from the first group of 'a's to create "aabaaaa".

Remove two 'a's from the second group of 'a's to create "aabaa".

No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "aabaa".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "aab"

**Output:** "aab"

**Explanation:** No three consecutive characters are equal, so return "aab".

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Solution
Loop over `s` and find the size of each group with consecutive equal characters. If a group has size less than three, than append all the characters to the result string. Otherwise, only append two of the characters to the result string. Finally, return the result string.
