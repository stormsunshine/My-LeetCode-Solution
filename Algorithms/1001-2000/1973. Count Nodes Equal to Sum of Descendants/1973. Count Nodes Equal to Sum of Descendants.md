# 1973. Count Nodes Equal to Sum of Descendants
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return *the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the **sum** of the values of its descendants*.

A **descendant** of a node `x` is any node that is on the path from node `x` to some leaf node. The sum is considered to be `0` if the node has no descendants.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [10,3,4,2,1]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

For the node with value 10: The sum of its descendants is 3+4+2+1 = 10.

For the node with value 3: The sum of its descendants is 2+1 = 3.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [2,3,null,2,null]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:**

No node has a value that is equal to the sum of its descendants.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [0]

**Output:** 1

For the node with value 0: The sum of its descendants is 0 since it has no descendants.

Constraints:

* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
* `0 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

## Solution
Do depth first search on the binary tree. For each node, calculate the sum of descedants and check whether the sum of descedants is equal to the node's value. If so, add the counter by 1. Finally, return the counter.
