# 1414. Find the Minimum Number of Fibonacci Numbers Whose Sum Is K
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given the number `k`, *return the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers whose sum is equal to* `k`, whether a Fibonacci number could be used multiple times.

The Fibonacci numbers are defined as:

* F<sub>1</sub> = 1
* F<sub>2</sub> = 1
* F<sub>n</sub> = F<sub>n-1</sub> + F<sub>n-2</sub>, for n > 2.

It is guaranteed that for the given constraints we can always find such fibonacci numbers that sum `k`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** k = 7

**Output:** 2 

**Explanation:** The Fibonacci numbers are: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ...

For k = 7 we can use 2 + 5 = 7.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** k = 10

**Output:** 2 

**Explanation:** For k = 10 we can use 2 + 8 = 10.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** k = 19

**Output:** 3 

**Explanation:** For k = 19 we can use 1 + 5 + 13 = 19.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= k <= 10^9`

## Solution
First, calculate all the Fibonacci numbers from 1 to `k` and use a tree set to store the Fibonacci numbers. Next, use greedy approach. For the number `k`, always subtract `k` with the maximum Fibonacci number that is less than or equal to `k`. Repeat the process until `k` becomes 0, and return the number of Fibonacci numbers used.
