# 1835. Find XOR Sum of All Pairs Bitwise AND
## Level
Hard

## Description
The **XOR sum** of a list is the bitwise `XOR` of all its elements. If the list only contains one element, then its **XOR sum** will be equal to this element.

* For example, the **XOR sum** of `[1,2,3,4]` is equal to `1 XOR 2 XOR 3 XOR 4 = 4`, and the **XOR sum** of `[3]` is equal to `3`.

You are given two **0-indexed** arrays `arr1` and `arr2` that consist only of non-negative integers.

Consider the list containing the result of `arr1[i] AND arr2[j]` (bitwise `AND`) for every `(i, j)` pair where `0 <= i < arr1.length` and `0 <= j < arr2.length`.

Return *the **XOR sum** of the aforementioned list*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr1 = [1,2,3], arr2 = [6,5]

**Output:** 0

**Explanation:** The list = [1 AND 6, 1 AND 5, 2 AND 6, 2 AND 5, 3 AND 6, 3 AND 5] = [0,1,2,0,2,1].

The XOR sum = 0 XOR 1 XOR 2 XOR 0 XOR 2 XOR 1 = 0.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr1 = [12], arr2 = [4]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** The list = [12 AND 4] = [4]. The XOR sum = 4.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 10^5`
* `0 <= arr1[i], arr2[j] <= 10^9`

## Solution
Use the distributive law. For integers `a`, `b` and `c`, there is `(a ^ b) & c == (a & c) ^ (b & c)` and `a & (b ^ c) = (a & b) ^ (a & c)`.

For `0 <= i < arr1.length`, the XOR sum of `arr1[i] & arr2[j]` where `0 <= j < arr2.length` is equal to `arr1[i] & (arr2[0] ^ arr2[1] ^ ... ^ arr2[arr2.length - 1])`.

Therefore, the XOR sum of the list is calculated as follows.

```
(arr1[0] ^ arr1[1] ^ ... ^ arr1[arr1.length - 1]) & (arr2[0] ^ arr2[1] ^ ... ^ arr2[arr2.length - 1])
```
