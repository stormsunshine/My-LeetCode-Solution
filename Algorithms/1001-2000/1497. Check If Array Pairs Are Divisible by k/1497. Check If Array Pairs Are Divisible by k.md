# 1497. Check If Array Pairs Are Divisible by k
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of integers `arr` of even length `n` and an integer `k`.

We want to divide the array into exactly `n / 2` pairs such that the sum of each pair is divisible by `k`.

Return *True* If you can find a way to do that or *False* otherwise.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** arr = [1,2,3,4,5,10,6,7,8,9], k = 5

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** Pairs are (1,9),(2,8),(3,7),(4,6) and (5,10).

**Example 2:**

**Input:** arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6], k = 7

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** Pairs are (1,6),(2,5) and(3,4).

**Example 3:**

**Input:** arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6], k = 10

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** You can try all possible pairs to see that there is no way to divide arr into 3 pairs each with sum divisible by 10.

**Example 4:**

**Input:** arr = [-10,10], k = 2

**Output:** true

**Example 5:**

**Input:** arr = [-1,1,-2,2,-3,3,-4,4], k = 3

**Output:** true

**Constraints:**

* `arr.length == n`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `n` is even.
* `-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`
* `1 <= k <= 10^5`

## Solution
For each integer in `arr`, calculate the remainder of the integer when divided by `k`. Use a map to store each remainder and the number of integers that have the remainder. For remainder `k / 2` in case that `k` is even and remainder 0, the number of integers must be even, and otherwise return `false`. For the other remainders, remainder `i` and remainder `k - i` must have the same number of integers. If this is not the case, return `false`. If no contradictions exist, return `true`.
