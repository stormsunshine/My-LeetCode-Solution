# 1842. Next Palindrome Using Same Digits
## Level
Hard

## Description
You are given a numeric string `num`, representing a very large **palindrome**.

Return *the **smallest palindrome larger than** `num` that can be created by rearranging its digits. If no such palindrome exists, return an empty string `""`*.

A **palindrome** is a number that reads the same backward as forward.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** num = "1221"

**Output:** "2112"

**Explanation:** The next palindrome larger than "1221" is "2112".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** num = "32123"

**Output:** ""

**Explanation:** No palindromes larger than "32123" can be made by rearranging the digits.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** num = "45544554"

**Output:** "54455445"

**Explanation:** The next palindrome larger than "45544554" is "54455445".

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= num.length <= 10^5`
* `num` is a palindrome.

## Solution
If `num` has an even length, then all characters occur even numbers of times. If `num` has an odd length, then only the middle character occurs an odd number of times, and the middle character must remain at the middle to make the string a palindrome. Therefore, only consider the first half of `num`.

Get the next permutation of the first half of `num`, and generate the second half of the next permutation of the first half to obtain the complete string of next palindrome.
