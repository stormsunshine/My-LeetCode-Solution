# 1798. Maximum Number of Consecutive Values You Can Make
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given an integer array `coins` of length `n` which represents the `n` coins that you own. The value of the `i-th` coin is `coins[i]`. You can **make** some value `x` if you can choose some of your `n` coins such that their values sum up to `x`.

Return the *maximum number of consecutive integer values that you **can make** with your coins **starting** from and **including** `0`*.

Note that you may have multiple coins of the same value.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** coins = [1,3]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** You can make the following values:
- 0: take []
- 1: take [1]

You can make 2 consecutive integer values starting from 0.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** coins = [1,1,1,4]

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:** You can make the following values:
- 0: take []
- 1: take [1]
- 2: take [1,1]
- 3: take [1,1,1]
- 4: take [4]
- 5: take [4,1]
- 6: take [4,1,1]
- 7: take [4,1,1,1]

You can make 8 consecutive integer values starting from 0.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [1,4,10,3,1]

**Output:** 20

**Constraints:**

* `coins.length == n`
* `1 <= n <= 4 * 10^4`
* `1 <= coins[i] <= 4 * 10^4`

## Solution
Sort the array `coins`. If the smallest value of `coins` is greater than 1, return 1.

Otherwise, calculate the maximum consecutive integer value that can be made from `coins` using a greedy approach. Initialize `curr = 1` and `index = 0`. If `index < n` and `coins[index] <= curr`, then add `coins[index]` to `curr` and increase `index`. Repeat the process until the conditions do not hold, and return `curr`.
