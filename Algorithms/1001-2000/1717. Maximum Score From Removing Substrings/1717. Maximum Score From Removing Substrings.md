# 1717. Maximum Score From Removing Substrings
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given a string `s` and two integers `x` and `y`. You can perform two types of operations any number of times.

* Remove substring `"ab"` and gain `x` points.
   * For example, when removing `"ab"` from `"cabxbae"` it becomes `"cxbae"`.
* Remove substring `"ba"` and gain `y` points.
   * For example, when removing `"ba"` from `"cabxbae"` it becomes `"cabxe"`.

Return *the maximum points you can gain after applying the above operations on `s`*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "cdbcbbaaabab", x = 4, y = 5

**Output:** 19

**Explanation:**
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaaabab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaaab" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ab" underlined in "cdbcbbaaab". Now, s = "cdbcbbaa" and 4 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcbbaa". Now, s = "cdbcba" and 5 points are added to the score.
- Remove the "ba" underlined in "cdbcba". Now, s = "cdbc" and 5 points are added to the score.

Total score = 5 + 4 + 5 + 5 = 19.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "aabbaaxybbaabb", x = 5, y = 4

**Output:** 20

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= x, y <= 10^4`
* `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Solution
Use a greedy approach. If `x >= y`, then consider removing `"ab"` first and removing `"ba"` next. Otherwise, consider removing `"ba"` first and removing `"ab"` next.

When removing substrings, update the score and generate the new string after removing the substrings, so that the next steps can be proceeded as well.

Finally, return the score.
