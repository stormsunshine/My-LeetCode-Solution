# 1954. Minimum Garden Perimeter to Collect Enough Apples
## Level
Medium

## Description
In a garden represented as an infinite 2D grid, there is an apple tree planted at **every** integer coordinate. The apple tree planted at an integer coordinate `(i, j)` has `|i| + |j|` apples growing on it.

You will buy an axis-aligned **square plot** of land that is centered at `(0, 0)`.

Given an integer `neededApples`, return *the **minimum perimeter** of a plot such that **at least** `neededApples` apples are **inside or on** the perimeter of that plot*.

The value of `|x|` is defined as:

* `x` if `x >= 0`
* `-x` if `x < 0`

**Example 1:**

**Input:** neededApples = 1

**Output:** 8

**Explanation:** A square plot of side length 1 does not contain any apples.

However, a square plot of side length 2 has 12 apples inside (as depicted in the image above).

The perimeter is 2 * 4 = 8.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** neededApples = 13

**Output:** 16

**Example 3:**

**Input:** neededApples = 1000000000

**Output:** 5040

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= neededApples <= 10^15`

## Solution
Obviously, the side of the garden must be even. Once the side of the garden is determined, the number of apples in the garden can be calculated. Use binary search to find the minimum garden side to collect enough apples. The perimeter is the garden side multipled by 4.
