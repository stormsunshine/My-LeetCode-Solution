# 1881. Maximum Value after Insertion
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given a very large integer `n`, represented as a string, and an integer digit `x`. The digits in `n` and the digit `x` are in the **inclusive** range `[1, 9]`, and `n` may represent a **negative** number.

You want to** maximize `n`'s numerical value** by inserting `x` anywhere in the decimal representation of `n`. You **cannot** insert `x` to the left of the negative sign.

* For example, if `n = 73` and `x = 6`, it would be best to insert it between `7` and `3`, making `n = 763`.
* If `n = -55` and `x = 2`, it would be best to insert it before the first `5`, making `n = -255`.

Return *a string representing the **maximum** value of `n` after the insertion*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = "99", x = 9

**Output:** "999"

**Explanation:** The result is the same regardless of where you insert 9.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** n = "-13", x = 2

**Output:** "-123"

**Explanation:** You can make n one of {-213, -123, -132}, and the largest of those three is -123.

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= n.length <= 10^5`
* `1 <= x <= 9`
* The digits in `n` are in the range `[1, 9]`.
* `n` is a valid representation of an integer.
* In the case of a negative `n`, it will begin with `'-'`.

## Solution
If `n` is positive, find the leftmost digit in `n` that is less than `x` and insert `x` to the left of the digit. If no such digit is found, insert `x` at the end of `n`.

If `n` is negative, find the leftmost digit in `n` that is greater than `x` and insert `x` to the left of the digit. If no such digit is found, insert `x` and the end of `n`.
