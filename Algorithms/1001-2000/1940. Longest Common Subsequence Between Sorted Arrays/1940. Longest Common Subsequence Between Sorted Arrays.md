# 1940. Longest Common Subsequence Between Sorted Arrays
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of integer arrays `arrays` where each `arrays[i]` is sorted in **strictly increasing** order, return *an integer array representing the **longest common subsequence** between **all** the arrays*.

A **subsequence** is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arrays = [[1,3,4],
                 [1,4,7,9]]
Output: [1,4]
Explanation: The longest common subsequence in the two arrays is [1,4].
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: arrays = [[2,3,6,8],
                 [1,2,3,5,6,7,10],
                 [2,3,4,6,9]]
Output: [2,3,6]
Explanation: The longest common subsequence in all three arrays is [2,3,6].
```
**Example 3:**
```
Input: arrays = [[1,2,3,4,5],
                 [6,7,8]]
Output: []
Explanation: There is no common subsequence between the two arrays.
```

**Constraints:**

* `2 <= arrays.length <= 100`
* `1 <= arrays[i].length <= 100`
* `1 <= arrays[i][j] <= 100`
* `arrays[i]` is sorted in strictly increasing order.

## Solution
Any element in the longest common subsequence must be in all of the arrays. Since all arrays are sorted in strictly increasing order, the same element does not exist more than once in the same array. Loop over all arrays and use a hash map to store each number's number of occurrences in all arrays.

Then loop over the shortest array among all arrays, and obtain the elements that have numbers of occurrences equal to the number of arrays. These elements form the longest common subsequence.
