# 1980. Find Unique Binary String
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of strings `nums` containing `n` unique binary strings each of length `n`, return* a binary string of length `n` that **does not appear** in `nums`. If there are multiple answers, you may return **any** of them*.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = ["01","10"]

**Output:** "11"

**Explanation:** "11" does not appear in nums. "00" would also be correct.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = ["00","01"]

**Output:** "11"

**Explanation:** "11" does not appear in nums. "10" would also be correct.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = ["111","011","001"]

**Output:** "101"

**Explanation:** "101" does not appear in nums. "000", "010", "100", and "110" would also be correct.

**Constraints:**

* `n == nums.length`
* `1 <= n <= 16`
* `nums[i].length == n`
* `nums[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Solution
The number range of numbers with binary string of length `n` is [0, 2^n - 1]. Convert all elements in `nums` into integers, and loop over the integers from 0 to 2^n - 1 and find the first integer that is not in `nums`.
