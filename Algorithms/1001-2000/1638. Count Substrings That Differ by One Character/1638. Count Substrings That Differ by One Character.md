# 1638. Count Substrings That Differ by One Character
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the number of ways you can choose a non-empty substring of `s` and replace a **single character** by a different character such that the resulting substring is a substring of `t`. In other words, find the number of substrings in `s` that differ from some substring in `t` by **exactly** one character.

For example, the substrings in `"[compute]r"` and `"[computa]tion"` only differ by the `'e'`/`'a'`, so this is a valid way.

Return *the number of substrings that satisfy the condition above*.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** s = "aba", t = "baba"

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by exactly 1 character:

("<u>a</u>ba", "<u>b</u>aba")

("<u>a</u>ba", "ba<u>b</u>a")

("ab<u>a</u>", "<u>b</u>aba")

("ab<u>a</u>", "ba<u>b</u>a")

("a<u>b</u>a", "b<u>a</u>ba")

("a<u>b</u>a", "bab<u>a</u>")

The underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** s = "ab", t = "bb"

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** The following are the pairs of substrings from s and t that differ by 1 character:

("<u>a</u>b", "<u>b</u>b")

("<u>a</u>b", "b<u>b</u>")

("<u>ab</u>", "<u>bb</u>")

The underlined portions are the substrings that are chosen from s and t.

**Example 3:**

**Input:** s = "a", t = "a"

**Output:** 0

**Example 4:**

**Input:** s = "abe", t = "bbc"

**Output:** 10

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 100`
* `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters only.

## Solution
For all substrings of `s`, loop over all substrings of `t` with the same length and check whether the substring of `s` and the substring of `t` differ by one character. If this is the case, add the counter by 1. Finally, return the counter.
