# 530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum [absolute difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_difference) between values of any two nodes.

**Example:**
```
Input:

   1
    \
     3
    /
   2

Output:
1

Explanation:
The minimum absolute difference is 1, which is the difference between 2 and 1 (or between 2 and 3).
```

**Note:** There are at least two nodes in this BST.

## Solution
First obtain the inorder traversal of the binary search tree, which contains all the values in the binary search tree in sorted order. Then calculate absolute differences between each pair of adjacent values in the inorder traversal, and return the minimum absolute difference.
