# 783. Minimum Distance Between BST Nodes
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a Binary Search Tree (BST) with the root node `root`, return the minimum difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

**Example:**
```
Input: root = [4,2,6,1,3,null,null]
Output: 1
Explanation:
Note that root is a TreeNode object, not an array.

The given tree [4,2,6,1,3,null,null] is represented by the following diagram:

          4
        /   \
      2      6
     / \    
    1   3  

while the minimum difference in this tree is 1, it occurs between node 1 and node 2, also between node 3 and node 2.
```

**Note:**

1. The size of the BST will be between 2 and `100`.
2. The BST is always valid, each node's value is an integer, and each node's value is different.

## Solution
Obtain the inorder traversal of the binary search tree, which contains all the values in the binary search tree in ascending order. Then compare each pair of adjacent values in the inorder traversal and find the minimum difference.
