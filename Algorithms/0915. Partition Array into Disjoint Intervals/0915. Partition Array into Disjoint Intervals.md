# 915. Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array `A`, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays `left` and `right` so that:

* Every element in `left` is less than or equal to every element in `right`.
* `left` and `right` are non-empty.
* `left` has the smallest possible size.

Return the **length** of `left` after such a partitioning. It is guaranteed that such a partitioning exists.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [5,0,3,8,6]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** left = [5,0,3], right = [8,6]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [1,1,1,0,6,12]

**Output:** 4

**Explanation:** left = [1,1,1,0], right = [6,12]

**Note:**

1. `2 <= A.length <= 30000`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 10^6`
3. It is guaranteed there is at least one way to partition `A` as described.

## Solution
Create an array `minRight` that has the same length as `A`, where `minRight[i]` represents the minimum element in the subarray `A[i..A.length-1]`. Then loop over `A` from left to right and maintain the maximum element met so far, which is `maxLeft`. Once an `index` such that `maxLeft <= minRight[index + 1]` is met, return `index + 1`. Since it is guaranteed that such a partitioning exists, the maximum possible return value is `A.length - 1`.
