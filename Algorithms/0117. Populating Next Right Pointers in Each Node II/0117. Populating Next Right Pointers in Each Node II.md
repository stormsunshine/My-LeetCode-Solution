# 117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary tree
```
struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}
```
Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

**Follow up:**

* You may only use constant extra space.
* Recursive approach is fine, you may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.

**Example 1:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/15/117_sample.png)

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,7]

**Output:** [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,7,#]

**Explanation:** Given the above binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.

**Constraints:**

* The number of nodes in the given tree is less than `6000`.
* `-100 <= node.val <= 100`

## Solution
If `root` is `null` or `root` has no children, then simply return `root`.

Use breadth first search so that each time all nodes on the same level are visited.

Use a queue to store nodes to be visited. Initially offer the root to the queue. Each time obtain the size of the queue, which is the number of nodes in the current level. Poll the nodes one by one and set each nodes' `next` to be the next node in the queue, except that the rightmost node in the level has `next` pointing to `null`.

If a node has children, offer the children to the queue for the next level's visit.
