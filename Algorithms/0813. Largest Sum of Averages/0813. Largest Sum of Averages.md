# 813. Largest Sum of Averages
## Level
Medium

## Description
We partition a row of numbers `A` into at most `K` adjacent (non-empty) groups, then our score is the sum of the average of each group. What is the largest score we can achieve?

Note that our partition must use every number in A, and that scores are not necessarily integers.

**Example:**

**Input:**

A = [9,1,2,3,9]

K = 3

**Output:** 20

**Explanation:**

The best choice is to partition A into [9], [1, 2, 3], [9]. The answer is 9 + (1 + 2 + 3) / 3 + 9 = 20.

We could have also partitioned A into [9, 1], [2], [3, 9], for example.

That partition would lead to a score of 5 + 2 + 6 = 13, which is worse.

**Note:**

* `1 <= A.length <= 100`.
* `1 <= A[i] <= 10000`.
* `1 <= K <= A.length`.
* Answers within `10^-6` of the correct answer will be accepted as correct.

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. First create an array `prefixSums` of type `double` and length `A.length + 1`, where `prefixSums[i]` is the sum of all elements in the prefix subarray of `A`, `A[0..i-1]`. Then create a 2D array `dp` of type `double` and have `A.length + 1` rows and `K + 1` columns, where `dp[i][k]` represents the largest sum of averages of subarray `A[0..i-1]` when partitioned into `k` groups.

For each `i` from 1 to `A.length`, `dp[i][1] = prefixSums[i] / i`. For `k` from 2 to `Math.min(i, K)`, loop over `j` from 1 to `i` and let `dp[i][k]` be the maximum possible value of `dp[j][k - 1] + (prefixSums[i] - prefixSums[j]) / (i - j)`.

Finally, return `dp[A.length][K]`.
