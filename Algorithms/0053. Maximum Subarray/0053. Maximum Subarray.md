# 53. Maximum Subarray
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example:**

**Input:** [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4],

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.

**Follow up:**

If you have figured out the O(*n*) solution, try coding another solution using the divide and conquer approach, which is more subtle.

## Solution
Scan the array once. At each step, the current sum can be either previous sum plus the current number or just the current number, and the greater one should be kept as the current sum. Store the maximum sum so far at each step.
