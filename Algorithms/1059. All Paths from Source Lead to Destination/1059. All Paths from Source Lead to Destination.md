# 1059. All Paths from Source Lead to Destination
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given the `edges` of a directed graph, and two nodes `source` and `destination` of this graph, determine whether or not all paths starting from `source` eventually end at `destination`, that is:

* At least one path exists from the `source` node to the `destination` node
* If a path exists from the `source` node to a node with no outgoing edges, then that node is equal to `destination`.
* The number of possible paths from `source` to `destination` is a finite number.

Return `true` if and only if all roads from `source` lead to `destination`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[0,2]], source = 0, destination = 2

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** It is possible to reach and get stuck on both node 1 and node 2.

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/16/485_example_2.png)

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,3],[1,2],[2,1]], source = 0, destination = 3

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** We have two possibilities: to end at node 3, or to loop over node 1 and node 2 indefinitely.

**Example 3:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/16/485_example_3.png)

**Input:** n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3],[2,3]], source = 0, destination = 3

**Output:** true

**Example 4:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/16/485_example_4.png)

**Input:** n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,1],[1,2]], source = 0, destination = 2

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** All paths from the source node end at the destination node, but there are an infinite number of paths, such as 0-1-2, 0-1-1-2, 0-1-1-1-2, 0-1-1-1-1-2, and so on.

**Example 5:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/03/16/485_example_5.png)

**Input:** n = 2, edges = [[0,1],[1,1]], source = 0, destination = 1

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** There is infinite self-loop at destination node.

**Note:**

1. The given graph may have self loops and parallel edges.
2. The number of nodes `n` in the graph is between `1` and `10000`
3. The number of edges in the graph is between `0` and `10000`
4. `0 <= edges.length <= 10000`
5. `edges[i].length == 2`
6. `0 <= source <= n - 1`
7. `0 <= destination <= n - 1`

## Solution
Use the idea of breadth first search. Starting from `source`, each time obtain all the nodes that can be reached in one step, and do search from the next nodes in the next step. If a node has no outgoing edges and the node is not equal to `destination`, return `false`. Do the process for at most `n` times since any path will end in `n` steps if there is no loop in the graph. If the destination is reached and the are no remaining nodes to be searched, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.
