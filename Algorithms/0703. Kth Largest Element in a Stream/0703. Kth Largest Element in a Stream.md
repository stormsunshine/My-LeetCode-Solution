# 703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream
## Level
Easy

## Description
Design a class to find the **k**th largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Your `KthLargest` class will have a constructor which accepts an integer `k` and an integer array `nums`, which contains initial elements from the stream. For each call to the method `KthLargest.add`, return the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.

**Example:**
```
int k = 3;
int[] arr = [4,5,8,2];
KthLargest kthLargest = new KthLargest(3, arr);
kthLargest.add(3);   // returns 4
kthLargest.add(5);   // returns 5
kthLargest.add(10);  // returns 5
kthLargest.add(9);   // returns 8
kthLargest.add(4);   // returns 8
```
**Note:**

You may assume that `nums`' length ≥ `k-1` and `k` ≥ 1.

## Solution
Create a global array `elements`. In the constructor, initialize `elements` with length `k`, and only add the `k` largest elements from the array `nums` to the array `elements`. Each time a number is inserted to the array `elements`, use the idea of insertion sort and insert the number at the correct position. The array `elements` is always sorted in descending order. Each time `add` is called, insert the new number into the array and return the number at index `k - 1` of array `elements`.
