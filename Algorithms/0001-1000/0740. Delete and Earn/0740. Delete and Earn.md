# 740. Delete and Earn
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array `nums` of integers, you can perform operations on the array.

In each operation, you pick any `nums[i]` and delete it to earn `nums[i]` points. After, you must delete **every** element equal to `nums[i] - 1` or `nums[i] + 1`.

You start with 0 points. Return the maximum number of points you can earn by applying such operations.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [3, 4, 2]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:**

Delete 4 to earn 4 points, consequently 3 is also deleted.

Then, delete 2 to earn 2 points. 6 total points are earned.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4]

**Output:** 9

**Explanation:**

Delete 3 to earn 3 points, deleting both 2's and the 4.

Then, delete 3 again to earn 3 points, and 3 again to earn 3 points.

9 total points are earned.

**Note:**

* The length of `nums` is at most `20000`.
* Each element `nums[i]` is an integer in the range `[1, 10000]`.

## Solution
If `nums` has length 0 or 1, then return 0 or `nums[0]`, respectively.

Use dynamic programming. Find the maximum value `max` in `nums`. Create an array `counts` of length `max + 1` where `counts[i]` represents the number of occurrences of number `i` in `nums`. Create an array `dp` of length `max + 1` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of points that can be earned when the numbers less than or equal to `i` are given. For `i = 1` or `i = 2`, `dp[1] = counts[1]` and `dp[2] = Math.max(dp[1], 2 * counts[2])`. For `i > 2`, `dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + i * counts[i])`. Finally, return `dp[max]`.
