# 897. Increasing Order Search Tree
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given a binary search tree, rearrange the tree in **in-order** so that the leftmost node in the tree is now the root of the tree, and every node has no left child and only 1 right child.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [5,3,6,2,4,null,8,1,null,null,null,7,9]

       5
      / \
    3    6
   / \    \
  2   4    8
 /        / \ 
1        7   9

Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6,null,7,null,8,null,9]

    \
     3
      \
       4
        \
         5
          \
           6
            \
             7
              \
               8
                \
                 9  
```
**Note:**

1. The number of nodes in the given tree will be between 1 and 100.
2. Each node will have a unique integer value from 0 to 1000.

## Solution
First obtain the inorder traversal of the binary search tree, which has all the values in the binary search tree in ascending order.

Then create a new root with the smallest value. Loop over each value in the inorder traversal, create a new node with the value, and set the previous node's right child to be the current node. Finally return the new root.
