# 988. Smallest String Starting From Leaf
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given the `root` of a binary tree, each node has a value from `0` to `25` representing the letters `'a'` to `'z'`: a value of `0` represents `'a'`, a value of `1` represents `'b'`, and so on.

Find the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.

*(As a reminder, any shorter prefix of a string is lexicographically smaller: for example, `"ab"` is lexicographically smaller than `"aba"`. A leaf of a node is a node that has no children.)*

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [0,1,2,3,4,3,4]

**Output:** "dba"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [25,1,3,1,3,0,2]

**Output:** "adz"

**Example 3:**

**Input:** [2,2,1,null,1,0,null,0]

**Output:** "abc"

**Note:**

1. The number of nodes in the given tree will be between `1` and `8500`.
2. Each node in the tree will have a value between `0` and `25`.

## Solution
Do breadth first search. Initially, for each node, the string is reversed, which means the string starts from root and ends at the current node. If a leaf is met, reverse the string and update the smallest string starting from leaf. Finally, return the smallest string.
