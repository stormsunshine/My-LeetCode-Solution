# 920. Number of Music Playlists
## Level
Hard

## Description
Your music player contains `N` different songs and she wants to listen to `L` (not necessarily different) songs during your trip.  You create a playlist so that:

* Every song is played at least once
* A song can only be played again only if `K` other songs have been played

Return the number of possible playlists. **As the answer can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.**

**Example 1:**

**Input:** N = 3, L = 3, K = 1

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** There are 6 possible playlists. [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1].

**Example 2:**

**Input:** N = 2, L = 3, K = 0

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** There are 6 possible playlists. [1, 1, 2], [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2], [1, 2, 2]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** N = 2, L = 3, K = 1

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** There are 2 possible playlists. [1, 2, 1], [2, 1, 2]

**Note:**

1. `0 <= K < N <= L <= 100`

## Solution
Use dynamic programming. Create a 2D array `dp` of `L + 1` rows and `N + 1` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of music playlists that has length `i` and contains `j` different songs. Initialize `dp[0][0] = 1`.

To obtain `dp[i][j]` where `1 <= i <= L` and `1 <= j <= N`, the `j`-th song in the playlist can either be a new song, which has `N - j + 1` choices, or an old song, which has `Math.max(j - K, 0)` choices. Therefore, it can be obtained that `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] * (N - j + 1) + dp[i - 1][j] * Math.max(j - K, 0)`. Finally, return `dp[L][N]`.
