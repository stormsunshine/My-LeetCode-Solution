# 625. Minimum Factorization
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a positive integer `a`, find the smallest positive integer `b` whose multiplication of each digit equals to `a`.

If there is no answer or the answer is not fit in 32-bit signed integer, then return 0.

**Example 1**

Input:
```
48
```
Output:
```
68
```
**Example 2**

Input:
```
15
```
Output:
```
35
```

## Solution
If `a` is less than 10, then simply return `a`. Otherwise, first check the prime factors of `a`. If there exists a prime factor of `a` that is greater than 10, then it is impossible to represent `a` using the multiplication of several one-digit numbers, so return 0.

To find the smallest positive integer `b`, `b` must have the shortest length, so consider the maximum possible one-digit factor first. Therefore, loop over `i` from 9 to 2, and divide `a` by `i` until `a` can't be divisible by `i`. Store the factors and append them in the reversing order to form `b`, and return.
