# 756. Pyramid Transition Matrix
## Level
Medium

## Description
We are stacking blocks to form a pyramid. Each block has a color which is a one letter string.

We are allowed to place any color block `C` on top of two adjacent blocks of colors `A` and `B`, if and only if `ABC` is an allowed triple.

We start with a bottom row of `bottom`, represented as a single string. We also start with a list of allowed triples `allowed`. Each allowed triple is represented as a string of length 3.

Return true if we can build the pyramid all the way to the top, otherwise false.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: bottom = "BCD", allowed = ["BCG", "CDE", "GEA", "FFF"]
Output: true
Explanation:
We can stack the pyramid like this:
    A
   / \
  G   E
 / \ / \
B   C   D

We are allowed to place G on top of B and C because BCG is an allowed triple.  Similarly, we can place E on top of C and D, then A on top of G and E.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: bottom = "AABA", allowed = ["AAA", "AAB", "ABA", "ABB", "BAC"]
Output: false
Explanation:
We can't stack the pyramid to the top.
Note that there could be allowed triples (A, B, C) and (A, B, D) with C != D.
```

**Note:**

1. `bottom` will be a string with length in range `[2, 8]`.
2. `allowed` will have length in range `[0, 200]`.
3. Letters in all strings will be chosen from the set `{'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F', 'G'}`.

## Solution
First convert the list `allowed` to a map, which maps a string of length 2 to a character that is allowed in an allowed triple.

Then do recursion. Each time an upper level's string is obtained, do recursion until the top level is met. In this case, return `true`. If it is not possible to reach the top level using allowed triples, return `false`.
