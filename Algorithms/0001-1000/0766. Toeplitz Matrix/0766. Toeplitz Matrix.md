# 766. Toeplitz Matrix
## Level
Easy

## Description
A matrix is *Toeplitz* if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same element.

Now given an `M x N` matrix, return `True` if and only if the matrix is *Toeplitz*.

**Example 1:**
```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1,2,3,4],
  [5,1,2,3],
  [9,5,1,2]
]
Output: True
Explanation:
In the above grid, the diagonals are:
"[9]", "[5, 5]", "[1, 1, 1]", "[2, 2, 2]", "[3, 3]", "[4]".
In each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1,2],
  [2,2]
]
Output: False
Explanation:
The diagonal "[1, 2]" has different elements.
```

**Note:**

1. `matrix` will be a 2D array of integers.
2. `matrix` will have a number of rows and columns in range `[1, 20]`.
3. `matrix[i][j]` will be integers in range `[0, 99]`.

**Follow up:**

1. What if the matrix is stored on disk, and the memory is limited such that you can only load at most one row of the matrix into the memory at once?
2. What if the matrix is so large that you can only load up a partial row into the memory at once?

## Solution
For each diagonal from top-left to bottom-right in the matrix, check whether all the elements in the diagonal are the same. The top-left position of the diagonal can be from `(M - 1, 0)` to `(0, 0)` and from `(0, 0)` to `(0, N - 1)`. If there exist a diagonal such that there are different elements in the diagonal, return `false`. Otherwise, return `true`.
