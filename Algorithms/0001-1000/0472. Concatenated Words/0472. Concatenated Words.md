# 472. Concatenated Words
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given a list of words (**without duplicates**), please write a program that returns all concatenated words in the given list of words.
A concatenated word is defined as a string that is comprised entirely of at least two shorter words in the given array.

**Example:**

**Input:**

["cat","cats","catsdogcats","dog","dogcatsdog","hippopotamuses","rat","ratcatdogcat"]

**Output:** ["catsdogcats","dogcatsdog","ratcatdogcat"]

**Explanation:** "catsdogcats" can be concatenated by "cats", "dog" and "cats"; 
 "dogcatsdog" can be concatenated by "dog", "cats" and "dog"; 
"ratcatdogcat" can be concatenated by "rat", "cat", "dog" and "cat".

**Note:**
1. The number of elements of the given array will not exceed `10,000`.
2. The length sum of elements in the given array will not exceed `600,000`.
3. All the input string will only include lower case letters.
4. The returned elements order does not matter.

## Solution
Use trie. Create a trie and insert all words into the trie. Then for each word, check whether it can be concatenated with several words in the trie. If so, add the word to the result list. Finally, return the result list.
