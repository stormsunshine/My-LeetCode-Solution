# 719. Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given an integer array, return the k-th smallest **distance** among all the pairs. The distance of a pair (A, B) is defined as the absolute difference between A and B.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

nums = [1,3,1]

k = 1

**Output:** 0 

**Explanation:**

Here are all the pairs:

(1,3) -> 2

(1,1) -> 0

(3,1) -> 2

Then the 1st smallest distance pair is (1,1), and its distance is 0.

**Note:**
1. `2 <= len(nums) <= 10000`.
2. `0 <= nums[i] < 1000000`.
3. `1 <= k <= len(nums) * (len(nums) - 1) / 2`.

## Solution
Use binary search. First sort the array `nums`. Then initialize `low = 0` and `high = nums[nums.length - 1] - nums[0]`, since the minimum possible absolute difference is 0, and the maximum possible absolute difference is the maximum element minus the minimum element.

Do binary search while `low < high`. Each time let `mid` be the average of `low` and `high`. For `right` from 0 to `nums.length - 1`, find the minimum index `left` such that `nums[right] - nums[left] <= mid`, and add `right - left` to the counter, which represents the number of pairs with distance less than or equal to `mid`. If the counter is greater than or equal to `k`, set `high = mid`. Otherwise, set `low = mid + 1`. Finally, return `low`.
