## Description
Given a picture consisting of black and white pixels, and a positive integer N, find the number of black pixels located at some specific row **R** and column **C** that align with all the following rules:

1. Row R and column C both contain exactly N black pixels.
2. For all rows that have a black pixel at column C, they should be exactly the same as row R.

The picture is represented by a 2D char array consisting of 'B' and 'W', which means black and white pixels respectively.

**Example:**
```
Input:                                            
[['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
 ['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
 ['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
 ['W', 'W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'W']] 

N = 3
Output: 6
Explanation: All the bold 'B' are the black pixels we need (all 'B's at column 1 and 3).
        0    1    2    3    4    5         column index                                            
0    [['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
1     ['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
2     ['W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', 'W'],    
3     ['W', 'W', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'W']]    
row index

Take 'B' at row R = 0 and column C = 1 as an example:
Rule 1, row R = 0 and column C = 1 both have exactly N = 3 black pixels. 
Rule 2, the rows have black pixel at column C = 1 are row 0, row 1 and row 2. They are exactly the same as row R = 0.
```

**Note:**
1. The range of width and height of the input 2D array is [1,200].

## Solution
Since this problem requires the rows should have exactly the same columns that have black pixels, map each row as a string to the count of the row, which means the number of rows that have this content.

Only consider the rows that have counts exactly `N`. For each such row, the row should contain exactly `N` black pixels, and for each position that is a black pixel, count the number of black pixels in the column. If there are exactly `N` black pixels in the column, then add `N` to the result. Finally, return the result.
