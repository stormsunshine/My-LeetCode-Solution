# 347. Top K Frequent Elements
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a non-empty array of integers, return the ***k*** most frequent elements.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3], k = 2

**Output:** [1,2]

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [1], k = 1

**Output:** [1]

**Note:**

* You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ *k* ≤ number of unique elements.
* Your algorithm's time complexity **must be** better than O(*n* log *n*), where *n* is the array's size.

## Solution
To obtain an algorithm with time complexity better than O(*n* log *n*), use maps. This solution has time complexity O(*n* log *k*).

Use two maps to store each number and its count and store each count and the numbers that have the count, respectively. The first map is a hash map and the second map is a tree map. Loop over `nums` to obtain each number and its count, and store the numbers and the counts in the first map. Then loop over the entries of the first map to obtain each cound and the numbers that have the count, and store the counts and the numbers in the second map. Initialize the second map such that keys are sorted in descending order. Then loop over the second map to obtain the k most frequent elements.
