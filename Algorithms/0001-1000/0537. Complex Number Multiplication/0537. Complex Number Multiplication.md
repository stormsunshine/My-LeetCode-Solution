## Description
Given two strings representing two [complex numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number).

You need to return a string representing their multiplication. Note i<sup>2</sup> = -1 according to the definition.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "1+1i", "1+1i"

**Output:** "0+2i"

**Explanation:** (1 + i) * (1 + i) = 1 + i2 + 2 * i = 2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+2i.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "1+-1i", "1+-1i"

**Output:** "0+-2i"

**Explanation:** (1 - i) * (1 - i) = 1 + i2 - 2 * i = -2i, and you need convert it to the form of 0+-2i.

**Note:**

1. The input strings will not have extra blank.
2. The input strings will be given in the form of **a+bi**, where the integer *a* and *b* will both belong to the range of [-100, 100]. And **the output should be also in this form**.

## Solution
Suppose the two complex numbers are *a=p+qi* and *b=r+si*, where *p*, *q*, *r* and *s* are integers. Then *ab=(pr-qs)+(ps+rq)i*. Use this rule to do the multiplication.
