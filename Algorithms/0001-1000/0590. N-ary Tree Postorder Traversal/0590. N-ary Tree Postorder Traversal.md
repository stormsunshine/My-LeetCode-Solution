# 590. N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given an n-ary tree, return the *postorder* traversal of its nodes' values.

*Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).*

**Follow up:**

Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]

**Output:** [5,6,3,2,4,1]

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/11/08/sample_4_964.png)

**Input:** root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]

**Output:** [2,6,14,11,7,3,12,8,4,13,9,10,5,1]

**Constraints:**

* The height of the n-ary tree is less than or equal to `1000`
* The total number of nodes is between `[0, 10^4]`

## Solution
Use two stacks to store the nodes to be visited. Initially, push the root into the first stack. Each time pop a node from the first stack and push the node into the second stack. Push all the node's children into the first stack from the leftmost to the rightmost. Continue the process until the first stack becomes empty. Then pop each node from the second stack and add the node's value to the postorder traversao list.
