# 850. Rectangle Area II
## Level
Hard

## Description
We are given a list of (axis-aligned) `rectangles`. Each `rectangle[i] = [x1, y1, x2, y2]`, where (x1, y1) are the coordinates of the bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of the top-right corner of the `i`th rectangle.

Find the total area covered by all rectangles in the plane. Since the answer may be too large, **return it modulo 10^9 + 7**.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [[0,0,2,2],[1,0,2,3],[1,0,3,1]]

**Output:** 6

**Explanation:** As illustrated in the picture.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [[0,0,1000000000,1000000000]]

**Output:** 49

**Explanation:** The answer is 10^18 modulo (10^9 + 7), which is (10^9-(10^9+7))^2 = (-7)^2 = 49.

**Note:**

* `1 <= rectangles.length <= 200`
* `rectanges[i].length = 4`
* `0 <= rectangles[i][j] <= 10^9`
* The total area covered by all rectangles will never exceed `2^63 - 1` and thus will fit in a 64-bit signed integer.

## Solution
Loop over `rectangles` and use a tree set to store all x-axis values in ascending order without duplicates. Then loop over all x-axis values in reversing order. Each time obtain two adjacent x-axis values. Loop over `rectangles`. If a rectangle's x-axis values are in the range of the two adjacent x-axis values, obtain the ranges in the direction of y-axis and add the area to the total area. Finally, return the total area.
