# 365. Water and Jug Problem
## Level
Medium

## Description
You are given two jugs with capacities *x* and y litres. There is an infinite amount of water supply available. You need to determine whether it is possible to measure exactly *z* litres using these two jugs.

If *z* liters of water is measurable, you must have *z* liters of water contained within **one or both buckets** by the end.

**Operations allowed:**

* Fill any of the jugs completely with water.
* Empty any of the jugs.
* Pour water from one jug into another till the other jug is completely full or the first jug itself is empty.

**Example 1:** (From the famous ["*Die Hard*" example](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BVtQNK_ZUJg))

**Input:** x = 3, y = 5, z = 4

**Output:** True

**Example 2:**

**Input:** x = 2, y = 6, z = 5

**Output:** False

## Solution
If `x + y < z`, then obviously it is impossible to measure *z* litres using the two jugs, so return `false`.

If `x + y >= z`, then calculate the greatest common divisor of *x* and *y*, and return `true` if and only if *z* is divisible by the greatest common divisor of *x* and *y*.
