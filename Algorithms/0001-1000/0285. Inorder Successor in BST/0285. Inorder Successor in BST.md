# 285. Inorder Successor in BST
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary search tree and a node in it, find the in-order successor of that node in the BST.

The successor of a node `p` is the node with the smallest key greater than `p.val`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [2,1,3], p = 1

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:** 1's in-order successor node is 2. Note that both p and the return value is of TreeNode type.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], p = 6

**Output:** null

**Explanation:** There is no in-order successor of the current node, so the answer is null.

**Note:**

1. If the given node has no in-order successor in the tree, return `null`.
2. It's guaranteed that the values of the tree are unique.

## Solution
If the node `p` has a right child, then the inorder successor is the leftmost node in `p`'s right subtree.

If the node `p` doesn't have a right child, then search for the inorder successor starting from the root. Use a stack to store all the nodes on the path from the root to node `p`. Pop elements from the stack until the stack's top node has a value greater than `p`'s value. In this case, return the stack's top node. If the stack becomes empty eventually, then `p` doesn't have an inorder successor, so return `null`.
