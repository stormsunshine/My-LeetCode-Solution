# 887. Super Egg Drop
## Level
Hard

## Description
You are given `K` eggs, and you have access to a building with `N` floors from `1` to `N`.

Each egg is identical in function, and if an egg breaks, you cannot drop it again.

You know that there exists a floor `F` with `0 <= F <= N` such that any egg dropped at a floor higher than `F` will break, and any egg dropped at or below floor `F` will not break.

Each move, you may take an egg (if you have an unbroken one) and drop it from any floor `X` (with `1 <= X <= N`).

Your goal is to know **with certainty** what the value of `F` is.

What is the minimum number of moves that you need to know with certainty what `F` is, regardless of the initial value of `F`?

**Example 1:**

**Input:** K = 1, N = 2

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

Drop the egg from floor 1. If it breaks, we know with certainty that F = 0.

Otherwise, drop the egg from floor 2. If it breaks, we know with certainty that F = 1.

If it didn't break, then we know with certainty F = 2.

Hence, we needed 2 moves in the worst case to know what F is with certainty.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** K = 2, N = 6

**Output:** 3

**Example 3:**

**Input:** K = 3, N = 14

**Output:** 4

**Note:**

1. `1 <= K <= 100`
2. `1 <= N <= 10000`

## Solution
Use dynamic programming and binary search. Create a 2D array `dp` of `N + 1` rows and `K + 1` columns, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of moves required  when there are `i` floors and `j` eggs. Initialize `dp[i][j] = i` for all `i` and `j`, initialize `dp[i][0] = 0` and `dp[1][i] = 1` for `1 <= i <= K`, and initialize `dp[i][0] = 0` and `dp[i][1] = i` for `0 <= i <= N`.

Then for `i` from 2 to `N` and `j` from 2 to `K`, use binary search to find `low `such that `Math.max(dp[low - 1][j - 1], dp[i - low][j])` is the minimum value, and update `dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[low - 1][j - 1], dp[i - low][j]) + 1`.

Finally, return `dp[N][K]`.
