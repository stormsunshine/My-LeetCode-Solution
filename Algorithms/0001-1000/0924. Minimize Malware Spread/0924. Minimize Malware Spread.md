# 924. Minimize Malware Spread
## Level
Hard

## Description
In a network of nodes, each node `i` is directly connected to another node `j` if and only if `graph[i][j] = 1`.

Some nodes `initial` are initially infected by malware.  Whenever two nodes are directly connected and at least one of those two nodes is infected by malware, both nodes will be infected by malware.  This spread of malware will continue until no more nodes can be infected in this manner.

Suppose `M(initial)` is the final number of nodes infected with malware in the entire network, after the spread of malware stops.

We will remove one node from the initial list.  Return the node that if removed, would minimize `M(initial)`. If multiple nodes could be removed to minimize `M(initial)`, return such a node with the smallest index.

Note that if a node was removed from the `initial` list of infected nodes, it may still be infected later as a result of the malware spread.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** graph = [[1,1,0],[1,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,1]

**Output:** 0

**Example 2:**

**Input:** graph = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]], initial = [0,2]

**Output:** 0

**Example 3:**

**Input:** graph = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]], initial = [1,2]

**Output:** 1

**Note:**

* `1 < graph.length = graph[0].length <= 300`
* `0 <= graph[i][j] == graph[j][i] <= 1`
* `graph[i][i] == 1`
* `1 <= initial.length <= graph.length`
* `0 <= initial[i] < graph.length`

## Solution
Do breadth first search to find each initially infected node's connected component. If the initially infected node is not removed, then all the nodes in the connected component will be infected.

If an initially infected node is removed, there are two possible cases.

The first case is that there is only one initially infected node in the connected component. In this case, if the initially infected node is removed, then none of the nodes in the connected component will be infected. If the current connected component's size is the largest, then update the removed node to be the initially infected node in the connected component.

The second case is that there are at least two initially infected nodes in the connected component. In this case, since only one initially infected node can be removed, the component will eventually be infected. If the node to be removed has not been found, then update the removed node to be the initially infected node with the smallest index in the connected component.
