# 993. Cousins in Binary Tree
## Level
Easy

## Description
In a binary tree, the root node is at depth `0`, and children of each depth `k` node are at depth `k+1`.

Two nodes of a binary tree are cousins if they have the same depth, but have **different parents**.

We are given the `root` of a binary tree with unique values, and the values `x` and `y` of two different nodes in the tree.

Return `true` if and only if the nodes corresponding to the values `x` and `y` are cousins.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,4], x = 4, y = 3

**Output:** false

**Example 2:**

![Image text](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2019/02/12/q1248-02.png)

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,4,null,5], x = 5, y = 4

**Output:** true

**Example 3:**

**Input:** root = [1,2,3,null,4], x = 2, y = 3
**Output:** false

**Note:**

1. The number of nodes in the tree will be between `2` and `100`.
2. Each node has a unique integer value from `1` to `100`.

## Solution
Do breadth first search on the binary tree. For each node, store its depth. If a node's children contain value `x` or `y`, then update the parent of the corresponding value. If both `x` and `y` are found, check whether they are in the same depth and they have different parents.
