# 996. Number of Squareful Arrays
## Level
Hard

## Description
Given an array `A` of non-negative integers, the array is *squareful* if for every pair of adjacent elements, their sum is a perfect square.

Return the number of permutations of A that are squareful. Two permutations `A1` and `A2` differ if and only if there is some index `i` such that `A1[i] != A2[i]`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [1,17,8]

**Output:** 2

**Explanation:**

[1,8,17] and [17,8,1] are the valid permutations.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [2,2,2]

**Output:** 1

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 12`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 1e9`

## Solution
Construct a graph from the original array. If `A[i] + A[j]` is a perfect square, then there is an undirected edge between `i` and `j`. Then do depth first search starting from each node to count the number of permutations. Since there may be duplicates in `A`, for each number in `A`, if it appears `k` times, then divide the number of permutations by `k!`.
