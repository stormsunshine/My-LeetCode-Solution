# 616. Add Bold Tag in String
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a string **s** and a list of strings **dict**, you need to add a closed pair of bold tag `<b>` and `</b>` to wrap the substrings in s that exist in dict. If two such substrings overlap, you need to wrap them together by only one pair of closed bold tag. Also, if two substrings wrapped by bold tags are consecutive, you need to combine them.

**Example 1:**

**Input:**

s = "abcxyz123"

dict = ["abc","123"]

**Output:**

"<b>abc</b>xyz<b>123</b>"

**Example 2:**

**Input:**

s = "aaabbcc"

dict = ["aaa","aab","bc"]

**Output:**

"<b>aaabbc</b>c"

**Note:**
1. The given dict won't contain duplicates, and its length won't exceed 100.
2. All the strings in input have length in range [1, 1000].

## Solution
Use an array with type `boolean` to determine whether each index should become bold. Find indices of all occurrences of strings from `dict` in `s`, and set all the indices where the keywords occur to be bold.

Loop over the string `s`, and add tags at start and end indices in `s`.
