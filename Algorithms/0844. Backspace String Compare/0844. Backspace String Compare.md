# 844. Backspace String Compare
## Level
Easy

## Description
Given two strings `S` and `T`, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. `#` means a backspace character.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** Both S and T become "ac".

**Example 2:**

**Input:** S = "ab##", T = "c#d#"

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** Both S and T become "".

**Example 3:**

**Input:** S = "a##c", T = "#a#c"

**Output:** true

**Explanation:** Both S and T become "c".

**Example 4:**

**Input:** S = "a#c", T = "b"

**Output:** false

**Explanation:** S becomes "c" while T becomes "b".

**Note:**

1. `1 <= S.length <= 200`
2. `1 <= T.length <= 200`
3. `S` and `T` only contain lowercase letters and `'#'` characters.

**Follow up:**

* Can you solve it in `O(N)` time and `O(1)` space?

## Solution
Use two string buffers to store actual characters in strings `S` and `T` respectively. For each string, if a letter is met, append the letter. If a `#` is met, then remove the last letter if the string is not empty. Finally, compare whether the two strings are equal.
