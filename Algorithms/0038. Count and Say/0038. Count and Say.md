# 38. Count and Say
## Level
Easy

## Description
The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:
```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```
`1` is read off as `"one 1"` or `11`.
`11` is read off as `"two 1s"` or `21`.
`21` is read off as `"one 2`, then `one 1"` or `1211`.

Given an integer *n* where 1 ≤ *n* ≤ 30, generate the &n&<sup>th</sup> term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

## Solution
Calculate each term of the sequence directly.
