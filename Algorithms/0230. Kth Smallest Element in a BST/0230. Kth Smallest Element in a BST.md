# 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given a binary search tree, write a function `kthSmallest` to find the **k**th smallest element in it.

**Note:**

You may assume k is always valid, 1 ¡Ü k ¡Ü BST's total elements.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
   3
  / \
 1   4
  \
   2
Output: 1
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
       5
      / \
     3   6
    / \
   2   4
  /
 1
Output: 3
```
**Follow up:**

What if the BST is modified (insert/delete operations) often and you need to find the kth smallest frequently? How would you optimize the kthSmallest routine?

## Solution
The inorder traversal of a binary search tree contains all values in ascending order. Therefore, obtain the inorder traversal of the binary search tree and return the kth smallest element.
