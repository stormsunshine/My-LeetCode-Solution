# 275. H-Index II
## Level
Medium

## Description
Given an array of citations **sorted in ascending order** (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): "A scientist has index h if *h* of his/her *N* papers have **at least** *h* citations each, and the other *N* - *h* papers have **no more than** *h* citations each."

**Example:**

**Input:** citations = [0,1,3,5,6]

**Output:** 3

**Explanation:** [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. Since the researcher has 3 papers with **at least 3** citations each and the remaining two with **no more than** 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.

**Note:**

If there are several possible values for *h*, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

**Follow up:**

* This is a follow up problem to [H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/description/), where `citations` is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
* Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?

## Solution
The solution is exactly the same as the solution to problem 274 except that in this problem, the array `citations` is already sorted. So simply use the solution to problem 274 with the step of sorting the array removed.
